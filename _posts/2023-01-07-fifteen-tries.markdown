I agree that Kevin McCarthy was metaphorically gelded over the course of the fifteen votes.  He'll be one of the weakest speakers in the history of the United States House of Representatives.  Any single member can initiate a vote to vacate the chair and oust him now.  He's on extremely thin ice.  It was still [a tight vote](https://mas.to/@w7voa@journa.host/109646292394939238).

![Post by Steve Herman. "McCarthy 216/Jeffries 212" The post contains an image with no original description.  The best description that can be added is that it is a screen capture from C-SPAN showing the vote totals and Kevin McCarthy sitting in the Hall of the House.

Glenn Fleishman certainly [wasn't amused by this situation](https://twit.social/@glennf/109646333955071585).

He also noted [the thin ice](https://twit.social/@glennf/109646359477884160) I was talking about too:

The madness has only just begun in DC, it seems.  I'm glad I am not a working civil servant any longer.  The thirty five day government shutdown in late 2018/early 2019 really did a number and I do not want the chance of going through *that* again.  Unfortunately the chance of something like that happening again has increased **exponentially** with this lot taking charge of the United States House of Representatives.
