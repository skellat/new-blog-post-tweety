Communications over the Windstream fiber connection are not functioning properly.  I don't think both GitHub and DriveThruRPG are down at the same time.  Unless there's been a nuclear attack on the West Coast that nobody noticed, this is a transport failure.

It makes it worse that it is an *intermittent* failure too!
