Frankly the only defense at this point seems to be to attack the theory of intent.  Was it truly criminal intent?  Was he simply being incompetent or addle-brained instead?  If he was acting in an incompetent fashion let alone an addle-brained fashion, why on earth would we allow him to participate in our electoral processes again?  

Notice the marked lack of answers there.  I frankly have no prognostication on-hand as to how any of this may turn out.  The "worst case scenario" notions are just too dire to try to comprehend right now.  

I think Ed Bott had the best take on the situation.  Quoting @edbott@mastodon.social: <https://mastodon.social/@edbott/110511328509215741> #retoot
