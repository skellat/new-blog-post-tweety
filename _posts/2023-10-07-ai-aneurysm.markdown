So, this is what I'm getting as a response from Bing Image Creator at the moment:

![We can't create your images right now \ Due to high demand, we're unable to process new requests. \ Please try again later. \ In the meantime, Explore other creations on the Image Creator homepage.]({{site.url}}/img/aneurysm-ai.jpg)

The text states:

>*We can't create your images right now*
>*Due to high demand, we're unable to process new requests.*
>*Please try again later.*
>*In the meantime, Explore other creations on the Image Creator homepage.*

I assume this is related to what Bellingcat is talking about in a recent report.  Quoting [@Bellingcat@mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social/@Bellingcat): <https://mstdn.social/@Bellingcat/111188168746055746> #retoot

It probably also related to what Peter Murray was posting about too.  Quoting [@dltj@code4lib.social](https://code4lib.social/@dltj): <https://code4lib.social/@dltj/111185408493064478> #retoot

All in all, this is not looking good.  Increasingly it looks like we have barely begun to consider the implications of what we're getting into with this software.  Humanity is fallen and broken so assuming good intent on the part of users with software like this is probably not the best of ideas.
