Well, Tim Walz was apparently picked as the running mate for Kamala Harris.  I apparently called it yesterday.  It wasn't exactly a *hard* call.  There was way, way too much of a full court press against Josh Shapiro.  The incendiary issue of Israel would've been inserted into the campaign if Governor Shapiro was selected too.  With protestors about Palestine already set to protest the Democratic National Convention a pick of Josh Shapiro would made too many waves in an environment that requires perfect pinpoint execution with almost no margin of error.

I'm still going to vote for the firm of Harris-Walz over Trump-Vance on November 5th.  We **CANNOT** go back to the madness of the Trump years.  The cost of doing so would simply be too high.
