A miscellany in no particular order:

* I didn't leave the house today due to the arctic conditions.  When the wind chill is almost thirty degrees below zero it is perhaps a bit too dangerous.  Fairport Harbor over in Lake County saw hurricane force winds from this nastiness.
* Development of the over-the-top network is stalled.  I have ordered a new Raspberry Pi 4B+ from PiHut in the UK.  That'll likely be used as a streaming head-end.  The problem is where the head-end would stream to in actual operations.
    * I really want to do a teletext carousel to push out on Twitch like TCI/Adelphia had on the old 1990s cable system on Channel 30.  That would help with the lack of prepared content at the moment.  YouTube has an example [out of Minneapolis](https://youtu.be/bhw25jFm5So) that presents the idea roughly.
    * I haven't finished putting my query together to fetch an appropriate weather conditions map from the National Digital Forecast Database.  That would be helpful to use in pushing a weather report in a semi-automated fashion.
    * A goal of such a project is to **NOT** do something like [this](https://vimeo.com/783282497) from [Conneaut CAT-TV](https://vimeo.com/user126359532) if we can help it.
    * Something arranged like [Geauga G-TV](https://geaugatv.org/contact) would probably work but we would ditch running on a cable system to be online only.  They have [video on-demand](https://vimeo.com/gtvvideos) on Vimeo.  Their work is funded via franchise fees received locally in Geauga County.
    * This still needs work.
* The Christmas Eve service at Geneva Church of Christ should prove interesting.  It **WILL** be streamed live on Twitch at <https://www.twitch.tv/GenevaChurchOfChrist/> starting at 2330 UTC on Christmas Eve.
* The set of *Computer Chronicles* episodes that I tagged on the experimental podcast feed over on the [ELP Television](https://coyote.works) site is at a healthy number.  The podcast feed has more programs in it than display on the site.
* I still haven't finished wrapping Christmas presents.  I suppose I should do that.
* I want to move somewhere warmer than Ashtabula.  The Caribbean sounds nice.  Moving back to American Samoa sounds nice too.  Brisbane would be fun if I could somehow manage it.  Until I feel comfortable enough getting all issues on the chart to being "well-managed" these can only be dreams.
    * I've already lived in American Samoa and it is a lush and verdant place.
    * I've visited part of the Caribbean.
    * I haven't yet quite managed to visit Australia notwithstanding trying to find ways to do so.
* Dating apps at this time of the year are not fun.
