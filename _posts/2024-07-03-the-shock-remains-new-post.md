Well, the shock hasn't settled.  Apparently that weird judicial opinion from the United States Supreme Court really did happen Monday.  I didn't dream it.  It really happened.

Media Matters For America is [reporting](https://www.mediamatters.org/project-2025/heritage-foundation-president-celebrates-supreme-court-immunity-decision-we-are) that Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts had some remarks in the aftermath of the *Trump v. United States* opinion dropping Monday.  Things that I didn't expect.  How on earth are we even going this direction?

Stay tuned, I guess?
