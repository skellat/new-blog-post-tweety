One of the problems of maintaining a blog in Jekyll is forgetting to `git commit` and then `git push`.  Sunday had blog posts written that should have been posted.  They existed solely on the storage space of my MacBook Pro M1, though.  I'm adding this *mea culpa* alongside my finally posting those posts.

Some days I can be slick about these sorts of things.  This is not one of those days, though.
