In no particular order:

+ The repo [containing tracking of my podcast listening](https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/Podcasting) is chugging along nicely with an update made just Tuesday
  + Hosting of this will stay on Launchpad
  + I have no intent to move it to GitHub at this time
+ I had a good chat with the {REDACTED} specialist doctor.  Being told that I am managing my care is a good thing, I guess.  Rare disease is never really fun.  With all the AI scrapers out there these days I most certainly cannot openly talk about {REDACTED} since that data might poison an AI somewhere.
+ I am waiting for a verdict in the Donald Trump trial in NYC
  + I have no *firm* guess as to how it will play out
  + My wild and uneducated guess would be a hung jury split 11-1 results in him walking away a free man
+ Graduation will be fun to work Saturday with [FLOTUS visiting](https://web.archive.org/web/20240525010833/https://www.wkbn.com/news/pennsylvania/first-lady-jill-biden-to-speak-at-pa-college-commencement/)
