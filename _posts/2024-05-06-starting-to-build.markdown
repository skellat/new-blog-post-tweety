Alrighty, we start first with *1d100 Spaceship Missions* by Terry Herc.  We'll roll using Dice by PCalc.

We get a 21.  That gives us this result:

>
>*Install a deep-space telescope in an unexplored region of space. The first images reveal an approaching, unknown massive
cosmic entity, sparking a sector-wide alarm. 125kcr*  
>

We turn to *Deep Space Backwater Planetoid Generator* by D10 Dimensions.  We'll roll using Dice by PCalc.  There are many multiple rolls to be made.  There are nine tables to be worked through.

The first throw is 1d20 + 3d10.  We get a 2 on the 1d20 and the 3d10 gives us 9, 8, and 4.  That gives us this result:

>
>*Hector OR Cassius OR Haru OR Chad*
>

And I will make a choice from those four which gives us:

>
>*Hector 984*
>

Our second throw will give us an orbital profile for Hector 984.  We roll a 1d20 and get a 14.  It gives us this result:

>
>*Small asteroid orbits it (micro-moon)*
>

Our third throw gives us features for Hector 984.  We roll a 1d20 and get 17.  That gives us this result:

>
>*Covered in broad, flat mild plains*
>

Our fourth throw is on the optional metals and minerals table.  We roll 2d20 and get 3 as well as 11.  That gives us these results:

>
>*Sulphur - Common but useful ore*
>*Crystals - Naturally formed in vacuum*
>

This place is already not looking like a vacation spot.

Our fifth throw is on the lifeforms table.  We roll 1d20 and get a 2 even though we almost got a 20.  That gives us this result:

>
>*No Life / Foreign life visited & then left*
>

Our sixth throw is on the signs of civilization table.  We roll up to 1d3 times on this table.  We first roll a 1d6, get a 2, and then divide that by 2 to get 1.  This means that we will only get to roll 1d20 on this table.  We roll 1d20 and get 6 which gives us this result:

>
>*Industrial Factory and Company Town*
>

Our seventh throw is a 1d10 to determine the planetoid's atmosphere.  We roll the 1d10 and get a 4.  That result gives us this cue:

>
>*Normal - Supports Life.*
>

Our eighth throw is a 1d10 to determine the planetoid's size and gravity.  We roll the 1d10 and get a 9.  That result gives us this cue:

>
>*(126 + 5d6 x 100) KM / 1.2 Gravity*
>

Our ninth throw is a 1d10 to determine the planetoid's place in the universe.  We roll the 1d10 and get a 8.  That result gives us this cue:

>
>*Tourist destination for old civilization*
>

Now we're starting to get somewhere, I think.

We turn to *1d100 Lost Transmissions* by Terry Herc and roll 1d100 three times.  We get 4, 17, and 27.  Those numbers give us these results:

>
>*[Distressed voice] "This is the cruiser Radiant Dawn. We’ve found an alien device on Xedros-3. It's started...reacting. I’m no
scientist, we need a specialist here, stat!"*
>
>*"Buying phase crystals. Offering double the galactic rate. Meet at the Trade Spire on Lyrion-4."*
>
>*"Anyone near the Draco Nebula, this is the Golden Falcon. We’ve found a driftiing colony ship. It's... old, like pre-hyperdrive
old. There are cryo-pods. We need help with salvage and rescue."*
>

We then turn to *1d100 Spaceships and Captains* by Terry Herc then throw a 1d100 again.  We get a 30 which gives us the following result:

>
>*Galaxy Grinder: Captain Dex Bolaris, an erstwhile gladiatorial champion, now known for his daunting presence and fearless nature. His ship, the Galaxy Grinder, is a former warship retrofitted into a combat sports arena, hosing thrilling intergalactic tournaments.*
>

We then turn to *200 Space Civilization Occupations* by D10 Dimensions and throw d100 three times.  That gives us 43, 66, and 31 which translates to these results:

>
>*Cyber Surgeon*
>
>*Laborer Overseer*
>
>*Bot Mechanic*
>

We then throw d100 two more times.  That gives us 72 and 7 which translates to:

>
>*Comms Tower Manager*
>
>*Space Pirate*
>

Well, we now have a scene, characters, and mission.  This gives us a start to building a story.  We'll actually start writing that story at a later time.
