Is it bad that I really want a home button simply for manual dexterity issues?  This feels like an accessibility concern.

My current iPad is now double discontinued.  That is to say, [the generation after my current iPad just got discontinued](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/ipad-9-discontinued-ipad-10-now-starts-at-349/).  I suppose I *may* be due for an upgrade soon enough.

Convertible sub-Macbook.  That's the only use case I can *currently* think of.  Something else might arise, I suppose.
