I am shocked and amazed that this works.  It wasn't the simplest of choices to go with a static site.  Initially I had thought about using [ikiwiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ikiwiki&oldid=1012497040) again but couldn't find server space I could both afford and not feel like I had to do too much fussing with.  Changes at Branchable [made it a non-option](https://web.archive.org/web/20210815110543/http://www.branchable.com/news/changes_at_Branchable/).  

We'll see how this experiment goes.  I may migrate more to this eventually.  Using [VSCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1117046041) to blog makes this a lot easier than I thought it would be.
