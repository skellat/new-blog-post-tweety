Our local daily newspaper, [*The Star Beacon*](https://www.starbeacon.com/), did not release an edition today.  According to its release pattern it *will not* release a paper tomorrow.  The last print edition that dropped was the combined weekend edition that came out on December 23rd.

As far as I can tell they didn't manage to replace the retiring reporter.  That'll leave them with a reporter, photographer/reporter, and editor.  That's not really enough to keep a daily newspaper functioning.

I'll be very interested in seeing if there is a newspaper edition at all on Wednesday.
