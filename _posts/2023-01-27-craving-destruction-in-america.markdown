![Post by Lauren Weinstein. "If I didn't know better, I'd almost think that the cable news channels -- all of them -- are rooting for there to be riots after that video is made public tomorrow." Posted on Jan 26, 2023 at 18:33]({{site.url/img/weinstein-riots-20230126.jpg}})

It would be a legitimate question to ask what Lauren Weinstein is asking about.  Fortunately the Internet Archive has a great program of capturing and transcribing television news.  A clip from the CBS Evening News bringing up the situation can be found at <https://archive.org/details/KPIX_20230127_023000_CBS_Evening_News_With_Norah_ODonnell/start/302.2/end/415.1> for reference.

The BBC's reporting [explains the Tyre Nichols case](https://web.archive.org/web/20230127052428/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64421704?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA) better than domestic sources, I suppose.  France24 [posted reporting from Reuters](https://web.archive.org/web/20230127052758/https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20230126-former-memphis-police-officers-charged-with-murder-in-death-of-tyre-nichols).

I don't have any "situational awareness" updates in my inbox.  The Homeland Security Digital Library has resources at <https://www.hsdl.org/c/policing-protests/> and <https://www.hsdl.org/c/search/?subjects=Protest+movements> available that may be useful.  Other guidance is out there in terms of dealing with protest situations.

What do I think will happen?  Frankly I do not know.  In northeast Ohio we have a little thing known as *winter* that would stop protests and riots from happening.  The forecast is calling for yet more lake effect snow to be followed by rather cold rains which will freeze and then even more snow.  People won't be out and about protesting and rioting in that mess in this area.  In other areas that don't see snow like we do locally their mileage may vary.

These interesting times are horrid.
