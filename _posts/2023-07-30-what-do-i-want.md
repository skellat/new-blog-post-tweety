Between staying busy with the working taskings and staying busy with the continuing care odyssey, the dating matter has basically been on ice.  Consider what I wrote on February 15th:

* The dating game looks weird.
  * Axios Columbus mentioned on Valentine's Day that [❤️ In Ohio, love is local](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-columbus-98c5a5a0-266a-4193-a96f-10630166e816.html?chunk=1&utm_term=emshare#story1)
    * Ohio is apparently one of the states where you're most likely to marry a local
    * Michigan ranks first in terms of states where that occurs while Ohio is fifth
    * We have very few out of state transplants here in Ohio
    * In the aggregate, interstate marriages are on the rise across the country which makes Ohio an outlier
  * I'm off any dating apps at the moment.  I seemingly cannot devote the attention to correctly use such programs.
  * There are many bad prospects in my immediate area.
  * Depending upon the test results that I am waiting on from the hospital this may be mooted

The test result I was waiting on then was a confirmatory genetic test that wound up indicating that I do indeed have a rare medical condition that is thankfully not transmissible *but is able to be inherited*.  That part right there freaks me out heavily when it comes to any idea of dating and relationships.  When you come from a religious tradition that values marriages and focuses heavily on them being tied to being procreative you end up feeling like a monster if procreation winds up being an insanely difficult proposition.  I could give someone some good years as a partner and we could adopt, of course.  That's not something really anybody goes for locally, though.  

A soprano voice with a slavic accent is something that definitely grabs my attention.  I've never really understood why.  Of course, growing up in the Slavic Village neighborhood in Cleveland might impact that a bit.

People I went to high school with are now welcoming grandchildren.  Consider that I am barely in my very early 40s.  They're welcoming *grandchildren*.  That does lead to not fitting in socially as I do not have those common life experiences.

These are things that just gnaw at me.  One day I will get them closer to resolution.  Today is not that day, though.
