I have a silly view of the VP pick.  Who do I think *should* be picked?  The best bet is Josh Shapiro, the Governor of Pennsylvania.  Who do I think *will* be picked?  More than likely it will be Tim Walz, the Governor of Minnesota.

This being the world turned upside down this campaign season frankly anything can happen.  We'll find out Tuesday, I suppose.
