Yes, I have been reading through the [Hack100](https://web.archive.org/web/20230515062254/https://hack100rpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Hack100_Rulebook_Release1_03.pdf) RPG rules.  These are much, much shorter than the rules for something like [*Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition*](https://web.archive.org/web/20231102214911/https://dnd.wizards.com/).  The Hack100 rules allow for the possibility of writing some interesting scenarios.  I am trained in terms of writing scenarios for [HSEEP](https://web.archive.org/web/20230524085912/https://preptoolkit.fema.gov/web/hseep-resources) so writing fantasy scenarios shouldn't be too, too hard.

I'm hitting a block for NaNoWriMo anyhow.  I have a basic start to a story.  It would make an offbeat RPG adventure, I think.  With outlets like [Clarkesworld still facing crapfloods from large language models](https://web.archive.org/web/20231003093522/https://neil-clarke.com/it-continues/) the chances of being able to successfully release a traditional story are decreasing day by day.

Even LaTeX supports [preparing materials for wargame engines like VASSAL](https://ctan.org/pkg/wargame) nowadays.  There are possibilities out there.  I just have to clean up the story treatment a bit and then get it converted into something marketable.

What a strange world we live in...
