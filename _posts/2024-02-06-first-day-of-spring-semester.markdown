It is going to be a fabulous day starting off teaching for the spring semester today.  It would be even better if I could *sleep* a bit before I have to teach in the daylight.  I'll have to sign off soon.

I think I have everything in readiness.  The jitters are what's keeping me up.  These always happen, it seems.
