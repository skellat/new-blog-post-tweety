The headline in *Deadline* is horrible.  What does it say?

[Trump’s “Haul Out The Guillotine!” Fundraising Email — Invoking Kathy Griffin — Draws Biden Counter Pitch](https://web.archive.org/web/20240613001814/https://deadline.com/2024/06/trump-guillotine-kathy-griffin-1235971973/)

The coverage in [*The New Republic*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240613052045/https://newrepublic.com/post/182620/trump-message-followers-dark-turn-guillotine) is not much better.  The [TV News Search from the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/tv?q=trump+guillotine&and%5B%5D=publicdate%3A%5B2009-06-04+TO+2024-06-13%5D&red=1&sort=-addeddate) didn't find any mentions of it in captions logged to the system there.  That would explain the Tommy Christopher article over at *Mediaite* entitled [‘Nobody’s Made A Big Deal!’ CNN’s Jim Acosta Stunned Trump’s Beheading-Themed Email Hasn’t Gotten More Attention](https://web.archive.org/web/20240612211506/https://www.mediaite.com/news/nobodys-made-a-big-deal-cnns-jim-acosta-stunned-trumps-beheading-themed-email-hasnt-gotten-more-attention/).  Axios talks about the matter in a piece entitled ["Haul out the Guillotine," Trump says in fundraising email](https://web.archive.org/web/20240613032346/https://www.axios.com/2024/06/12/trump-guillotine-fundraising-email-democrats).

Between that Axios report and [one in Axios where it is reported that Trump stated he will pursue his enemies if elected](https://web.archive.org/web/20240607223852/https://www.axios.com/2024/06/06/trump-hannity-biden-prosecution-fox-news), there are things to be considered here.  First and foremost, how many of his followers are accepting this as a call to commit violence in support of him?  After all, one of the January 6th rioters who is in prison at the moment [is reportedly establishing a new militia across the country at the moment on a cellular structure](https://web.archive.org/web/20240612203847/https://www.wired.com/story/january-6-rioter-leading-armed-national-militia-from-prison/) per *WIRED*.  Even if other groups were broken thanks to the prosecutions, the sheer scale of the situation and how long the prosecutions has taken has allowed the conspiracy to regroup and reform.

Trump is being sentenced on July 11th.  Contingency plans should be established, I suppose.
