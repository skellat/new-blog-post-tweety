Well, there is a [Patreon creator account](https://patreon.com/erielookingproductions) established.  

Why do this?  Well, backup contingency plans are always useful to have in place.  I have no security of tenure in the work that I am doing right now in the "day job" so it can disappear at any time.  

What sort of things would I be creating in such a circumstance?  Well, I have a running file of story ideas that I haven't fully developed yet.  Some of it looks sci-fi and some of it looks quite absurd.  Writing and then typesetting using the [novel class on CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/novel) would allow for pursuing various publishing routes.  Of course, the [repo on GitHub for "novel"](https://github.com/rallg/novel) claims that its use is becoming discourage and that a new class will become available any day now.  I did make three things that I published using Amazon KDP and the novel class.  Using the [newspaper class on CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/newspaper) might allow for publishing short fiction on a recurring basis too.
