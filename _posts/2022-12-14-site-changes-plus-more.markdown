I've modified the site structure a little bit.  The front page is only going to show links to seven posts.  The RSS feed will contain *twenty* posts.  Posts aren't being nuked but the idea is to push things off to the RSS feed so things age off the front of the site.  Scrolling down a front page that seems to be just infinitely scrolling titles bothers me.

In a few hours I will be wrapping up teaching this term.  It has been quite an experience teaching a class in Computer & Information Systems.  There have been plenty of challenges but I think I managed to get past them without too much difficulty.

Christmas Eve service at church was announced and planning remains in progress.  I will be likely handling technology that night.  A big problem we have right now is getting audio input to the streaming computer to stay stable.  I'm going to have to hack on that on Thursday morning.

I didn't lose the congregation on Sunday when I was preaching.  That's a good thing.  I was surprised to have as many as I did show up.

I'll write more later, I assume.
