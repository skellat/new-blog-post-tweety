Yeah, it totally slipped my mind that this event was even taking place.  I've still been reeling from events arising from recent visits to medical practitioners.  I'm stuck a bit in the Windows world thanks to a current work tasking.

# Health

Health matters are frankly just weird right now.  I have an ever-expanding cast of specialists that I get to see that cover a fairly wide range of disciplines.  Test results have been sufficiently weird that collaboration between specialists will be essential, it seems.

# Economic fate of Ashtabula County

The produce giveaways run in partnership with Country Neighbor Program and Greater Cleveland Food Bank are seeing record numbers of participants seeking help.  This is **not** the normal I wanted to have come back.  Our economy isn't in the greatest shape and things are in a bit of a downward spiral.

Oddly enough, we were doing far better economically during the lockdown times and the limited activity times.  Local businesses were still able to stay open.  We've had quite a few closures lately.  All that is posted to [the OhioMeansJobs search engine](https://ohiomeansjobs.ohio.gov) right now is work in the retail and medical sectors.

# Setting up news services in Ashtabula County

I'm still trying to work out the finances to doing something like this.  I *may* try to seek out donors at the Best Of The County event at Spire Institute being held Tuesday night.  Beyond that there is simply no clear path forward.

# Starting a newsletter

This seems to be in vogue.  I'm not sure it would be successful locally.  If I try anything it had best be with *low* financial investment.
