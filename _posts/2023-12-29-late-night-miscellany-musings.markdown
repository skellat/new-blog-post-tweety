In no particular order:

+ The [scripture package on CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/scripture) just got updated.  I may need to look into its use.
+ On January 15th we have the "Social Media Parental Notification Act" coming into effect [here in Ohio](https://web.archive.org/web/20231228045917/https://fox8.com/news/new-rules-for-ohio-kids-on-social-media-coming-soon/).  Where is [NetChoice](https://netchoice.org) when you need it?
+ The doctor visit Thursday resulted in some plan changes
  + I am not sure how these will go
  + All there is right now is to move forward with the experiment
+ When even one of your doctors tells you that you've had a rough year after looking at your chart, perhaps you shouldn't feel bad about feeling bad?
