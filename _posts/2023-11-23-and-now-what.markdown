In no particular order:

+ MST3K Turkey Day marathon continues
  + This time it is a two day event
  + The season 14 fundraiser continues
  + I'm not sure the fundraiser is actually going to succeed this time
  + They need four million dollars and only have $2,264,368 (at last check today) with under two days left
+ The project slate for 2024 is clear at the moment
  + All that appears to be on the board is starting a TTRPG program event at the library
  + The usual regular health surveillance activities are also on the table
    + Regular for me that is
    + For anybody else they would be an indication that something was drastically wrong
    + For me it boils down to living with things that show up in (REDACTED) and GARD
  + It is too early to know if I will have anything happening in Erie
+ Setting up an archivebox instance seems like a swell idea this weekend
+ Trump is getting really freaky lately and is scaring the crap out of a whole lotta people
+ I tried Kapwing and was less than enthused with its output
+ I have access to Adobe Creative Cloud and I suppose I need to play with it a bit now

And finally...

With [Stability.ai announcing their video-producing model](https://stability.ai/news/stable-video-diffusion-open-ai-video-model), I can only wonder what a base picture like this would end up producing:

![The prompt: "Three college-aged, short curl-straightened raven-black haired, feminine, rather tall, rather curvy, broad chested, wasp-waisted, very lean, very thickly muscle-bound, long-limbed female bodybuilder Celtic warrior monks dressed in durable tropical exercise attire from the faraway land of Nicodranas are jogging with heavy handheld weights and b≈ç staves.  They are jogging together along the lakeshore near the school they attend, Weirdsister College."]({{site.url}}/img/maidens.jpg)
