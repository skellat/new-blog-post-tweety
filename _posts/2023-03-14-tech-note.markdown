If all goes well I should be installing the various versions of vanilla TeX Live 2023 this weekend.  That assume pretest goes well.  I'm not in a position to be a tester for it, unfortunately.  The various devices will use platform-appropriate distributions of vanilla TeX Live.  Distro-packaged versions of TeX Live are nice but I prefer to track updates in CTAN.  Using distro-packaged versions of TeX Live doesn't let you do that without much weeping and gnashing of teeth in my experience.

What do I want to be doing?  I want to be typesetting fiction again soon.  I may end up printing a news rag that would go up on Issuu or another such platform.  The new PDF production logic should make things more archive-safe, I think.

We'll see what erupts this weekend, hopefully.
