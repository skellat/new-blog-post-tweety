In no particular order:

* Reading about PTEN continues.  People can ask me via alternate paths as to what's going on in that domain.  It is very complicated.
* We had enough rain to bring the Ashtabula River up to a flood level.  Where do I normally take Petey to walk?  Park spaces in the river gulf!  Petey has been unhappy walking around the neighborhood so the picky chihuahua didn't go anywhere Wednesday.
* Starting the video podcast hit a new roadblock that was unexpected.  Getting past the roadblock remains a work in progress.
* It looks like I will be digging into launching a crowdfunding effort this spring.  The [Ohio Minimum Wage](https://com.ohio.gov/static/documents/2023MWPoster.pdf) is $10.10 per hour and depending upon where you put "podcaster" in the classification schema the prevailing hourly wage locally starts around [$12.63](https://flcdatacenter.com/OesQuickResults.aspx?area=3900002&code=27-4012&year=23&source=1), [$16.26](https://flcdatacenter.com/OesQuickResults.aspx?area=3900002&code=27-2012&year=23&source=1), or [$21.60](https://flcdatacenter.com/OesQuickResults.aspx?area=3900002&code=15-1299&year=23&source=1).  Payroll costs are inevitable as this podcasting effort would not be possible as a solo project.
* This year is already going in unexpected directions.  I'm not quite sure where things are headed.
