The Huffington Post: [Trump Says He Might 'Encourage' Russia To Attack NATO Allies](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/trump-russia-attack-nato-allies_n_65c7e443e4b069b665dfb762)

They linked out to a video at <https://www.youtube.com/live/0aRBV2O2WEQ> which I needed to download just the captions from.  I wasn't watching an almost two hour video of that man ranting and raving.  If anything, the report might have missed something.

The command stanza invoking yt-dlp used in this instance was:

>*yt-dlp --skip-download --write-auto-subs --embed-subs --embed-metadata --concurrent-fragments 32 --downloader aria2c --downloader-args "-s16 -j16 -x16" --windows-filenames --trim-filenames 64 --mtime  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aRBV2O2WEQ"*

The *de facto* transcript in WebVTT form is a horrifying read.  The man is nuts.

Thanks to [Karen Coyle](https://mstdn.social/@kcoyle) for flagging this mess on Mastodon.
