![Post by popey. "@tilvids üëã  I'm looking for a possible home for @linuxmatters and the rest of the @LateNightLinux family of shows. We have RSS feeds, and a YT channel.

I only just spotted this today.  This could explain why I've been looking at things like migrating [Geneva Church of Christ](https://www.genevachurchofchrist.org) off YouTube streaming to something like [Microsoft Teams town halls](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-town-hall-in-microsoft-teams-33baf0c6-0283-4c15-9617-3013e8d4804f) or just using [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/features/livestreaming).  Google is flaking out in weird ways.  If I trusted the local infrastructure in Ashtabula County I would be starting an [owncast](https://owncast.online) node to just be done with it and manage it ourselves.  Unfortunately our local infrastructure is crap and the closest data center is in [Youngstown](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Youngstown,_Ohio&oldid=1221588283).

With all the protests going on across the country as well as at [prominent events like last night's Met Gala](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/dozens-arrested-after-hunter-college-protesters-try-to-reach-met-gala/), I suppose having things like this locked down *might* be important.  Life may wind up disrupted.  Keeping communications open will be important.
