Well, we are at the point where the past sixty days have had us at **a floor** of ten percent COVID-19 test positivity in Ashtabula County.  This is the general point where things are considered out of control.  Yeah, our case counts are down.  Our hospitalizations are up, though.  This puts the validity of our testing numbers in doubt.

Practice happened on Saturday and covered not just today but also Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  I *think* we may be ready.  The livestream will be running during the Christmas Eve service and with the number of people we have watching regular services it is safe to assume we'll have higher viewership Saturday night.
