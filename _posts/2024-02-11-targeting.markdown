The text from the statement image states:

>
>*STATEMENT OF GENERAL (RET.) WESLEY K. CLARK, FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER AND VOTEVETS SENIOR ADVISOR, ON DONALD TRUMP ENCOURAGING PUTIN TO ATTACK NATO*
>
>*"On 9/11, when America was under attack, NATO nations all mobilized to come to our defense and fought alongside us to crush al Qaeda. They didn't ask us for money. They didn't put strings on it. That is the kind of iron-clad commitment that has kept western democracies -- including our own -- alive for 75 years.*
>
>*"For Donald Trump to publicly signal to Vladimir Putin that he can take as much of Europe as he wants, and we will sit by and cheer him on, isn't just breaking the promise the United States has made, and it isn't just threatening Europe. It is encouraging World War Ill, which will hit our shores and cost American lives.*
>
>*"It is the kind of statement that can only come from a deranged and twisted mind. I do not say this lightly: The lives of every American, both in uniform and civilian, are at severe risk if Donald Trump wins this election."*
>

The folks at [POLITICO lined up the remarks Trump made](https://web.archive.org/web/20240211202913/https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/02/11/wild-and-dangerous-trump-upstages-elderly-biden-00140853?nname=playbook&nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&nrid=00000171-1404-d255-a375-74bd15840000&nlid=630318) in South Carolina with other remarks he's made and it seems the major European leader he was referring to was Ursula von der Leyen.  Trump wasn't telling the prime minister of a small country that they would metaphorically be thrown to the wolves.  He apparently was saying this to the head of the European Commission.

Mom and Dad are getting nervous with this too.  They're outright asking if we're slipping into a Weimar-style situation.  History is repeating, seemingly.
