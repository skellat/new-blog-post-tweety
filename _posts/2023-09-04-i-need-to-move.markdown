In no particular order:

+ I need to move.
  + Sunday night sounded like World War III in the neighborhood.  The firing off of fireworks is **banned** within city limits but people really don't care any more.
  + We have multiple economic aspects locally entering an adverse spiral situation.
  + There are even more Confederate battle flags popping up in unexpected places locally
    + This area was a major terminus of the Underground Railroad!
    + The new [copperheads](https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Copperheads) appear to overlook history like [Morgan's Raid](https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Morgan%27s_Raid)
+ Building a standalone streaming channel is hard
  + The regular installer for [OpenBroadcaster](https://openbroadcaster.com/) seems to be borked
  + I've been looking for a suitable broadcast automation solution for streaming video on a somewhat constant flow
    + There needs to be a bit more than a single live program flowing
    + I want to have a "broadcast day" that can be programmed
    + I recognize that setting up my own instance of [owncast](https://owncast.online/) for doing something like this would be needed
  + I don't have a suitable fiscal structure in place to support such an effort
    + A sole proprietorship isn't the safest thing to do with the amounts of money involved
    + It takes time to get the paperwork cleared to set up an Ohio LLC
    + I would have to hunt around to find a decent bank to use for corporate treasury services
    + These are all predicate steps to launching any sort of crowd-funding effort
  + Our local daily newspaper owned by [CNHI](https://www.cnhi.com/) is becoming a ghost of its former self
    + There seems to be no easily understandable reason why it is still being published
    + Averaging only 12-16 broadsheet pages per issue is not a plan to stay in business let alone remain a "newspaper of general circulation" under Ohio legal ad standards
    + The only other newspapers in the county are the regional weeklies that share the same editor and almost all the same content
    + As this isn't getting better we need to do *something*
  + Commercial real estate is a nightmare here that has held this back and I still don't have a good answer to it
+ Work continues
  + The commute is still rough
  + As legislation moves through its steps in the statehouse in Columbus, doing this sort of work tasking in Ohio is increasingly not in the cards
+ Church life continues
  + We're still streaming and people are still watching
  + I'm still there at Geneva Church of Christ
  + As much as we may not like it, we've come to accept that in an area with as bad of a set of health outcomes as Ashtabula County there will be a wider range of "shut ins" with nasty health issues who won't be able to rejoin us in the sanctuary in the current environment
+ I shot my mouth off about starting an actual play podcast of Linux world people playing a suitable TTRPG and now I'm wondering how I can make that happen
