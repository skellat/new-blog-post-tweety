It always feels weird that I *feel better* after I do a significant chunk of writing.  Writing keeps me going in so many ways.  I have mixed feelings about the "Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys" time in my life that stretched from mid-1998 through late-2000 when I had a byline and appaeared in print rather regularly.  The last time my byline has appeared in actual newsprint was 2005, if memory serves.

There's a tremendous push to "be normal" in this community and get jobs that don't really exist locally.  A person is seen as defective and wrong if they don't have a job in manufacturing, agriculture, or health care.  I am not seen as "normal" and I often have trouble accepting that.  Writing appears to fill some sort of a hole in my life yet I end up trying to write when I can.

These are things I will eventually resolve.  Today is not that day, though.
