In no particular order:

* I've sectioned off from the [main repo on Launchpad](https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/auto-newspaper) a test run of the newspaper code and [slapped it up on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/kellat/kellat.bitbucket.io/src/main/).
  * A single leaf of legal-size paper is probably the best that can be managed right now.
  * I don't have any reporting staff.
  * I don't really have bulk printing capability at the moment either.
  * This is the easiest thing to get off the ground at the moment.
  * I *do* have [a basic account on issuu](https://issuu.com/coyoteworks) but uploading LaTeX output there requires a wee bit more work yet to be appropriately usable.
  * This might be something that could be launched in 2023
    * Delivery logistics would be a problem
    * Pricing would be an issue
    * This would need a staff, too
  * My second job ever was as a writer for a newspaper so I have confidence that I could make *something* happen
    * The first job?  Custodian.
    * I have no regrets about the first job.  I got it while I was still in high school.  The money earned from that let me participate in the foreign exchange in high school and visit Paris as well as southern France in 1998.  I haven't been to Europe this century but I have been to Europe.
* My stress levels have been a bit elevated.  How can I tell?  Impacts related to the diagnosed rare eye disease are how I can tell.
* The biggest thing through the COVID-19 pandemic is the idiotic response by many Americans that if someone doesn't kill you you'll be able to get through it and be fine on the other side of your struggle.  Those ignorant fools don't understand how there are so many ways human beings can be crippled by illnesses and diseases.  That just bothers me greatly in so many ways.  Those bumptious fools have likely never lived with chronic conditions of any sort so that whole realm of experience is alien to them yet I know it rather well.
* The poor people in Buffalo are getting pounded with even more snow.  They're getting close to the five feet mark again.  I don't envy them.  
* I have to get out to Robot Zero Comics in Geneva eventually.  They have a couple things in that I ordered.  IDW has published some comic books with further adventures of the various *Star Trek* shows that explicitly tell stories that fall between the airing seasons.  Considering how much unwatchable crap is on the television lately and that there is no new *Star Trek* airing at the moment I shouldn't dawdle on picking up my order.
  * It feels weird getting into comic books as an adult.
  * I have a wonderful collection of regular books at home so comic books are just another type of item in the home library.
* I need to listen to the free story from Big Finish Productions that I downloaded that Ian Potter wrote.  First up I have to finish listening to the Captain Scarlet story I am listening to.
* I'm striking out on the current dating app.  There are just way too many explicitly antivaxx people who are vocal in their profiles to hit "PASS" on right now.
