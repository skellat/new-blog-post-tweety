The headline: "‘This Country Needs A Dictator!’ Trump Fans At Iowa Rally Say ‘Absolutely’ They Want Dictator Trump Over Biden"

The lede: 

>*Trump fans at an Iowa rally were near-unanimous when asked if they’d prefer former President Donald Trump as a “dictator” over reelecting President Joe Biden — one even said “This country needs a dictator!” and another compared Trump to a much-needed “paddling” for the nation.*  

I must seriously work harder on getting an escape plan together.  My position is compromised.  People are *literally* calling for dictatorship.  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?  

The USA had a good 247 year run, I guess.
