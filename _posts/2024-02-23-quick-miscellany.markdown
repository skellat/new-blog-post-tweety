In no particular order:

+ I am feeling overwhelmed with things at points lately
  + I am the most busy right now that I have been since October 2019
  + If I have to pull the ripcord and let some things go I will
  + The uncontrolled twitch in an eye is usually a good indicator that *something* is not okay
+ Emigration continues to be a thought
  + The near-criminalization of IVF in Alabama is pushing me down this path
    + Our state legislators in Columbus have never met a bad idea they wouldn't otherwise try to copy
    + This could be coming soon throughout the country
  + Trump is gaining steam in trying to take back the "Weather Headquarters"
    + Dude is doubling down on the dictatorship plans
    + The whole "Project 2025" planning out there shows that there is a vast army of sycophants ready to back him in taking things in quite a new direction
  + Canada is increasingly *not* an option
    + They have a medical care crisis up there
    + People lack access to primary care physicians
    + As someone dealing with The Condition, I need to have fairly easy access to not just primary care but also to specialists
      + Dermatology would be very important
      + Endocrinology would be very important
      + Gastroenterology would be very important
      + Neurology would be very important
      + The only know *integrated* team for such things on Earth is at Cleveland Clinic in **Cleveland, Ohio**
+ The social front is very stunted right now
  + It does help not being seen by some members of the local area as "the enemy"
  + It is one thing to talk of polarization in the abstract and it is another to feel it up close and personal
+ Teaching
  + I enjoy teaching
  + I do not enjoy the commute
+ Migration in the Fediverse
  + I have to migrate off my current Mastodon host
  + I've made some initial configuration efforts with Wordpress.com and am fidding it too fiddly at the moment with all that I have going on
  + There is no real way for me to bolt ActivityPub support onto a Jekyll static site blog hosted on GitHub Pages
  + Mastodon isn't the only thing that speaks ActivityPub
    + I do have a presence on Lemmy but totally forgot the password so that recovery should be interesting
    + I do have a presence on Bookwyrm but haven't logged in for a while
    + Identica itself is still up and running though it does not support ActivityPub *yet*
  + Nothing is decided yet and I have some time to consider things
