Well, this may get bad very quickly.  He's going to be *persona non grata* in a whole lotta countries as of now, I think.  I don't think any of the members of the UN really tolerate visits by convicted felons.

A convicted felon as a Head of State is a problem.  Why do people want this loser to be president again?  He wasn't exactly all that great as POTUS last time.
