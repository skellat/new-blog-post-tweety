We're now in April.

Today is [April Fool's Day](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=April_Fools%27_Day&direction=next&oldid=9217343).  Traditionally people play practical jokes and pranks today.  I get it as to the cultural import of today.

How about we skip it this year?  The world is metaphorically on fire and people are not going to react correctly to jokes.  The last thing we need is to give cover to Donald John Trump for the craziness he is spewing in-person and online.
