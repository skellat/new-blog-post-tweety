As to this [clip from C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5090137/user-clip-donald-trump-worry-voting), I am not sure things will go smoothly next year.  Glenn Fleishman [thinks things will be okay](https://web.archive.org/web/20231025194432/https://twit.social/@glennf/111297160699427985) but I have my doubts.  Donald Trump seems to increasingly be visiting fairy land.

Checking on the status of various boltholes is probably a good idea, I suppose.
