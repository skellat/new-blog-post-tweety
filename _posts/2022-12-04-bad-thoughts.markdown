In this situation currently I'm looking at a bit of a mess.  We literally have a former president calling for a dictatorship.  That's not just my assessment but one shared by others such as [Heather Cox Richardson](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/december-3-2022).

What do we do with this?  This guy *cannot* blow off steam.  When he says incendiary things people wind up acting on them.  How else did the Capitol Insurrection occur?

I already had someone tell me to look for work in Ireland.  There may be [one](https://www.churchofchrist.ie/) or [two](https://thechurchofchrist.ie/) resources to look at in that regard.  What they're seeing develop out here in the USA pretty much has happened before in Europe.  It isn't pretty.

A big question is if this is going to be like 1990s Bosnia or 1930s Germany.  History gets ignored at our peril.
