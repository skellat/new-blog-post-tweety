Here I am assigning homework on Christmas Day of all things.  Consider the integration of [NNCP with git](http://www.nncpgo.org/Git.html) as well as [git bundles](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) and the [git bundle format](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitformat-bundle).  What sort of high level handler would *you* want to help escort your information back and forth in a possibly disconnected or partially connected world?  With the very possible return of Donald Trump to power we'll be heading towards a somewhat authoritarian world.  Moving things around via [sneakernet](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet) and [e-mail over non-Internet routes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email) may be our best cases in the not so distant future.
