The presentation at Harbor-Topky Memorial Library Thursday night went well.  There was a technical mishap that prevented filming the event.  My PC laptop crapped out in terms of the USB host controller, it seems.  The laptop otherwise functions but trying to hook up a peripheral will be a lost cause.

I had more attendees than I expected.  That was a good thing.  The interesting bit will be whether or not such things happen again in the future.  With no assignments at the educational institution set for 2024 yet I might try to add events with less of a commute to my calendar.
