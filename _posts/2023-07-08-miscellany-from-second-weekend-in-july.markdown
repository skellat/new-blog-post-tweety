In no particular order:

* I'm a bit nervous about how much the various media conglomerates are deleting content online
  * Our tax code in the USA is biased in weird ways to favor them doing things like this
  * From an archival perspective looking at tools like `yt-dlp` you end up with invocations looking like *yt-dlp --xattr-set-filesize --restrict-filenames --continue --embed-thumbnail --video-multistreams --audio-multistreams --write-auto-subs --embed-subs --embed-metadata --embed-chapters --xattrs --concurrent-fragments 32 --downloader aria2c --downloader-args "-s16 -j16 -x16" --windows-filenames --trim-filenames 64 --mtime --no-remove-chapters* perhaps
* Threads is getting overrun with right-wing extremists apparently
  * Taylor Lorenz [posted screenshots](https://mastodon.social/@taylorlorenz/110675339989968302) of right-wing extremists being *confused* by it, though
  * Steve Herman [posted a link](https://journa.host/@w7voa/110674927731088308) to a story [in Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/threads-false-information-label-donald-trump-jr-error) where warning labels are being removed from the accounts of right-wing influencers who are setting up on Threads
  * Adam Mosseri claims [Threads won't "encourage" politics or "hard news"](https://techhub.social/@Techmeme/110674284274327762) but it seems like that statement may prove hollow based upon organic user behavior
  * Although I created an account on Threads, [I nuked it](https://ubuntu.social/@alpacaherder/110674058853084466) which resulted in my destroying any presence I had on Instagram too
  * Ruth over at glammr.us [posted an update](https://glammr.us/@platypus/110672719513626758) that glammr.us is preemptively blocking Threads based upon Moms For Liberty popping up in multiple spots on Threads
  * Will Threads becoming the new Gab?  Time will tell.
* Items from the RSS feeds have been weird

* I'm finding that I am a halfway decent teacher when it comes to computer basics
* I'm finding that hiding any talent or skill in the arts so as to conform to the business worlds expectations of efficiency and productivity to keep the mighty engine of capitalism running has not necessarily been good for me.  I certainly would have been far happier if I had previously let artistic expression flow more in my life.
