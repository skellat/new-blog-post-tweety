In no particular order:

* I am back in the classroom teaching on Monday.  
  * The class I teach is a Windows-centric class.  
  * I end up teaching basics of computer use.  
* It looks like the first proper episode of [69 Admins](https://69admins.com/) will be recorded soon for release on April 15th.  
* Learning about [edbrowse](https://www.edbrowse.org/usersguide.html) seems to be an item to consider.  
* I'm not looking forward to the outpatient procedures coming up in a few days.  They're not exactly the most comfortable things to have to go through.  
  * There's still a rather large amount of diagnostic appointments this month.
  * The appointment with the MD who is acting as "quarterback" isn't until May.
  * What test results exist already are not exactly the simplest things to process.  Then again, these are the fringes of known medical science that are being explored.
* Either UVB-76 is breaking down [or something is shifting for the worse](https://hackaday.com/2023/04/08/russias-new-mystery-shortwave-station/)
* I have to push work ahead on how to relocate to the United Kingdom somewhere near the University of Southhampton.  Why there?  There is a particular specialist there who collaborates with the specialists in Cleveland that I need to consult with.  If I had to make a run for it that would be one way to ensure continuity of care adequately.
  * Melbourne in Australia would be a second option.
  * Italy would be another option except I don't speak Italian.
  * It still feels weird that the top world authorities in something would be based in Cleveland, Ohio.
* Once the current primary election concludes and is canvassed it will show me as having "crossed the aisle".  This is intentional.  Sometimes you have to walk away from madness.
* Eventually more will be written but that will be saved for another time.
