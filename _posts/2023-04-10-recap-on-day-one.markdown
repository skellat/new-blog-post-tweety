I praise the Lord for giving us things like [Big Finish Productions](https://bigfinish.com/) in our world.  Listening to dramas from [The Worlds of Gerry Anderson](https://www.bigfinish.com/collections/v/the-worlds-of-gerry-anderson) as well as [Doctor Who](https://www.bigfinish.com/hubs/v/doctor-who) makes the drive from home to the college that much more tolerable.  It is definitely a shorter distance to get to this teaching site compared to the other two but I'm still traveling about 40 miles *one-way*.

Class went far better than I expected it would this morning.  I only wound up with two-thirds of my enrolled students showing up for the first day of class.  We went over the syllabus, got everybody into Blackboard, did some familiarization with Microsoft Teams, got everybody set up with the e-textbook, did a "diagnostic exercise" to assess student skills, talked about Microsoft Teams some more, watched a couple relevant current installments of the vodcast [Tech Break](https://twit.tv/shows/tech-break), discussed ChatGPT a little, and then gave the homework that'll be due Wednesday.  Office Hours was well attended with student questions and concerns.

I think this will be a good group.  The length of the term is eight weeks and bearing in mind the day we skip for a holiday we'll wrap up on Monday, June 5, 2023.  There's quite a bit to cover in this three semester credit class.

Use of generative AI is **not** forbidden to my students.  They have been cautioned that such tools can lie and don't always show their work in producing documents.  In my class it is still necessary for them to show me that they have the manual skills to create certain sorts of documents.

One of my absolute favorite romps from Big Finish is their [Space: 1999](https://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/v/space-1999) revival.  I highly recommend it.  It does *not* mimic the storylines entirely of the original television series.  It was part of a great round of stories to listen to during the fall semester commuting to teaching.

As odd as it may seem for this blog there actually can be good news at times.
