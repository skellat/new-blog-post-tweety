Thankfully we got to have the very first commencement ceremonies at the college on Saturday.  It is unique to be part of a school's foundational history.

My last class of the term is on Monday.  After that I will be starting a new section about two weeks later.  I am still teaching the same course.  Due to all the storm and stress in the realm of computing lately my syllabus has to be rewritten pretty much every time I teach the class.

This goes very well, I think.
