Well, the college's website is now MIA.  I've run `traceroute` but the results just end up going nowhere.  A check of `whois` indicates that the domain was just updated on November 1st.  A check of isup dot me showed that they have no problems accessing the college website so I'm stumped.  Fortunately I only have to teach CIS and am not back-end IT for the whole college.

The shrieking of MAGA partisans in a pro-Putin/anti-Ukraine fashion is really disturbing me.  If they win control of Congress we're going to be heading into a very dark biennium.  I am going to enjoy *The Mads Are Back* with another great movie riffing on Tuesday night in the live show since I can't really do the anxiety of the results all that well.

According to the Ohio Department of Health ranking it seems Ashtabula County is seventh in the state for COVID-19 transmission at the moment.  That's a dubious honor.

On a positive note, though, I am making this look like an actual normal blog.
