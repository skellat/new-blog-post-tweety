Do I feel icky mentioning that I have a Ko-Fi account?  Yes, I do.  I will note that it can be found at <https://ko-fi.com/smkellat>.  Right now it shows an "arbitrary target" in the goal area.  Every little bit helps defray costs.  Ashtabula County is [in the bottom third of the state](https://web.archive.org/web/20240119101143/https://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/2020/01/every-ohio-city-and-county-ranked-for-median-family-household-income-census-estimates.html) in terms of average annual income and we won't go into what side of the line I fall on.  

This is one of the many reasons why it feels like two different worlds when I travel to Erie to teach.  In terms of socioeconomic standing *it truly is a different world* in each area.  It gets disconcerting at times.
