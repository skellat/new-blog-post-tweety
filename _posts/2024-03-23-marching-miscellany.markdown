In no particular order:

+ The past several days have been very rough for horrible reasons
  + Church services on Sunday are in flux due to an incident
  + I am waiting for family to come home from greater DFW and the Indy metroplex after all the arrangements get made due to a totally separate incident
  + There *will* be an episode of [69 Admins](https://69admins.com/) produced this week though details are sketchy at the moment
+ There are software-defined radio efforts starting back up
+ I have a simulation to plan for Tuesday to conduct as DM
+ This story about [the shipboard fire on the M/V Cuyahoga](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/cuyahoga-ship-fire-1.7145431) in the Ashtabula City Harbor just sticks with me lately
+ Yeah, I am intimidated by the virulence of the MAGA people locally
+ Am I thinking about genetic oncology this weekend?  Yep.  Seeing such things prominently in the news give plenty of opportunities to ruminate.
+ What a horrifying time we're in at the moment...
