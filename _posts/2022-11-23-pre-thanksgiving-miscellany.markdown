Once more with feeling...

* It appears that I won't know any time soon if I will be teaching in the spring.  
  * Apparently not many of the faculty know what they'll be teaching in the spring.
  * I am not alone in not having any assigned sections.
  * I'm not depending upon income from teaching, of course.
* Twitter is becoming more of a nightmare.
  * The explore tab is now quite full of QAnon-related and antivaxx-related content.
  * My mentions tab now recommends QAnon-related and antivaxx-related content to me.
  * Debirdify isn't picking up any more Mastodon handles being added to Twitter profiles so what I have is what I have, I think.
  * There is a push to bring even more MAGA craziness back to Twitter.  That has implications for societal cohesion.
  * Limited reports indicate that the Twitter CEO is refusing to pay the rent on commercial properties utilized by the company.  The evictions could get very interesting.
* Very little else is happening in my life at the moment.
  * The COVID-19 pandemic helped ensure many of the social circles that existed prior for me would cease to exist.
  * Being in the wintry season brings about complications for me too.  Access to parks is limited due to snow.  Even if the snow melts there is still a possible subsidence danger until the groundwater table handles all the melt.
  * I really don't need too many material things that I don't otherwise have.  I won't be going "battle shopping" on Friday.
  * My personal library collection is over three hundred volumes now and I may need to actually do some weeding.
* Politics is getting weird locally.
  * I've essentially napalmed most bridges this year in terms of making any runs as a candidate.
  * In a pretty public fashion I have disassociated myself from what is now the mainstream of thought in the Republican Party.  I am not pro-MAGA by any stretch of imagination.
  * Two at-large seats on Ashtabula City Council are up for election in 2023 *are* up for election.  
    * I stand very little chance of success running as an independent.
    * The two spots are basically more aggravation than they're worth.
  * If a presidential appointment with senate confirmation or a gubernatorial appointment with senate confirmation was on offer I would quite possibly consider it.  The likelihood of any such thing being on offer is less than me winning the lottery.  Anybody interested in nominating me can look at the Plum Book as to federal positions, I suppose.  The Governor of Ohio's home page has a section listing positions too plus a form to nominate people to him.
* There are no clear plans for 2023.
  * Nothing is really certain right now.
  * Unless I get offered a section or two to teach I'll be back to planning no more than two weeks ahead.
  * No grand plans are even in mind right now.
* Life is just very weird these days.
