This site is coming up on its one year anniversary.  Once the one year mark is hit on October 28th I will have taught five sections of my class at the college and will be already teaching my sixth section.  This has been an exciting time making a positive difference in people's lives.

There isn't always negativity associated with me.  Sometimes there is positivity.
