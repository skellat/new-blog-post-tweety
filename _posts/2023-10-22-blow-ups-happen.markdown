Screw it, I was going to write about something else but I wound up deleting it.  It was for the best.  If you read the backscroll on that channel you read the backscroll on that channel.  Just know that I am quiet on that channel because I have been really, really busy with stuff at the college rather than trying to duck people.

[Total Party Kill](https://www.theincomparable.com/tpk/) is the best escapism that I can get at the moment.  Frankly commuting an hour each way to teach in [Erie](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erie,_Pennsylvania&oldid=9061305) is hard.  Random health goofiness hasn't helped either.  Listening to Tony Sindelar run games while I am driving on [Interstate Route 90](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interstate_90&oldid=8969887) and [Interstate Route 79](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interstate_79&oldid=5516605) helps keep me going on the long drives.  I also listen to programs from [Big Finish Productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Finish_Productions&oldid=1179492428) quite a bit while on the road, too.

I have been looking at a [TinyD6 quickstart](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/232269/Mad-Magicks-of-the-Turned-God-A-Tiny-Dungeon-2e-Quickstart).  These are useful sorts of things.  What that might lead to is a different question, though.  Additional escapism is the goal.

The world is looking really bleak this autumn.  We'll all be needing some escapism, I think.
