Another miscellany in no particular order:

* Apparently we are at some risk of having [Jim Jordan as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/14/house-gop-leadership-elections-2022-elections-00066664)
* I've started back up using the treadmill thanks to how cold it is getting outside
* I have no wish to try to run for elected municipal office in Ashtabula City in 2023
* I'm finding the quick hits in the Anderson Entertainment audio dramas for *Thunderbirds* quite interesting in terms of the references to *The Prisoner* as well as the Dan Dare comics
* Will Donald Trump announce Tuesday night his campaign for 2024?  Hopefully he will do no such thing.  Unfortunately all indications are that he will be doing so especially as some House Republicans already leaked on Twitter endorsements of him running.
* Is this a moment of calm before a storm?
