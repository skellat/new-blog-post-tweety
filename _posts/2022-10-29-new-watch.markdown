Friday involved me heading out to MicroCenter in Cleveland.  I wound up buying an [Apple Watch SE](http://web.archive.org/web/20221029043435/https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-se/).  I got the black sport band and a screen protector for it.  

Why do something like this?  I've had two health care providers tell me to get a fitness tracker in the past seven days.  This was the one they recommended getting.  Currently I am on Plan C with respect to a [particular health issue](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/losing_weight/getting_started.html) so we're going down the road of trying to resolve it through self-directed actions.

In other news in no particular order: 

* Teaching continues in Erie
* I'm still scratching my head over the meaning of INTJ-T
* Tension continues relative to the madness in the body politic
* The urge to do the bug-out boogie to other lands remains
