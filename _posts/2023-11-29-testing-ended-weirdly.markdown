Previously I had said that I would be wrapping up the 2023 medical tests battery on Monday.  That did not happen.  The practitioner took a look at my chart and deemed the situation too complicated for them to address.  I was given names and telephone numbers for other providers to contact to try to schedule with.

This means that the diagnostic odyssey for 2023 is concluded.  The baseline that has been established is a tricky mess.  It isn't a shining exemplar of good health.  It isn't a pessimistic bit of gloom and doom either.  It is just a new situation that I have to adapt to that lacks *well-known* precedents.

There's nothing new scheduled in the diagnostic odyssey until April when we pick back up with certain bits of testing again.  At that point we would be able to compare two discrete sets of results.  The hardest part to all of this is the waiting, alas.
