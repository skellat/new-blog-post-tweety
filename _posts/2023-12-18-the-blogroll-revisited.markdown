Is it random?  Pretty much.  Is it full of judgment calls?  YES!  I could totally add [Total Party Kill](http://totalkill.party/) to the list as that has been a thing keeping me going lately.  Of course, the stories from [Big Finish Productions](https://www.bigfinish.com/) have helped too.

Yes, my interests are a bit weird.  The news has just be so bleak lately that I have been trying to *not* follow it.  There is escapism and there is escapism.  I really, really do not want to consider what's looming at least until the primary election which is coming up on March 19, 2024.
