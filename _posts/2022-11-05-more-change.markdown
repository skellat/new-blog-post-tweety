I got the church's Twitter video streaming terminated.  The leadership will not be comfortable having services livestreamed on a site where Elon Musk is acting out in the way he is right now.  We're going to stick to YouTube and Twitch for the time being.  I may add back a third stream destination but that's something that requires a bit of research.

I had figured we would have had *some* time to transition into this.  This is moving far more rapidly than I had expected it would.
