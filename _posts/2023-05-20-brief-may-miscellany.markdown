In no particular order:

* The Writer's Guild of America strike continues
  * Network television line-ups for the fall are increasingly becoming mixes of "unscripted" and foreign acquisitions.
  * I am going to be clearing my [Big Finish](https://www.bigfinish.com) backlog as well as my [comic book](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comic_book&oldid=8831423) backlog and my [graphic novel](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graphic_novel&oldid=8749592) backlog.
* I am exploring the creation of SCORM content
  * SCORM stands for [Shareable Content Object Reference Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model&oldid=1135535399)
  * Right now I am using [eXeLearning](https://github.com/exelearning/iteexe) for authoring
* I have to look into the copyright and license status of the [sounds effects archive](https://blog.archive.org/2023/05/20/crash-bark-boom-the-usc-sound-effects-library/) recently highlighted by the Internet Archive
* The debt ceiling crisis continues
  * It looks like X-Date may hit *before* June 1st
  * On Friday the departmental offices at 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue indicated that USD$92 billion remain under "extraordinary measures"
    * That's the amount of money the federal government basically has left on-hand
    * It has no authority to borrow more
    * At a cash burn rate of USD$10-15 billion per day that leaves about 6-9 days of operating cash
    * Any major [disaster](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Disaster&oldid=8642347) would accelerate the burn rate on operating cash
      * Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1st and even though predictions are for a [below average season](http://web.archive.org/web/20230516203047/https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html) it only takes one bad storm to cause major impact
      * Further wildfires, an earthquake, a ["civil disturbance"](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Civil_disorder&oldid=1144672335), or other situation could also be a major disaster
  * Negotiations [appear to still be going poorly](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/05/20/statement-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-on-a-reasonable-bipartisan-budget-agreement/)
* If I ever managed to start building a data center in Ashtabula County, I would probably be using several of [these](https://www.raptorcs.com/content/TL2SV1/intro.html) as the core compute capacity
* This article on how [genetics determines our life choices](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230509-how-genetics-determine-our-life-choices) had one part that bothered me when it came to mate selection.  That line stated in pertinent part: "...we tend to form attachments with people who have certain physical similarities to ourselves."  What if you have a certain physical distinctiveness that is shared with at most fifty thousand other people on this planet?
