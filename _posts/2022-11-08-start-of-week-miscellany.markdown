In no particular order:

* I suppose I need to look at [twtxt](https://github.com/buckket/twtxt) a bit.
* I had not planned on opening an account on a Mastodon node any time soon yet [it seemed to have happened anyhow](https://mas.to/@smkellat).
* The network connection bounced at church during service Sunday.  That caused the livestream to be disrupted.  The [recording had to be posted after service](https://youtu.be/ygrygzUnsL8) to replace the incomplete stream recording that [YouTube had](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs1dDMVsjKcgeOynUXZkZww) on the channel.  Surprisingly [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/GenevaChurchOfChrist) was able to handle the bounce a bit better.
* I am down to six in class.  This does not reflect well on my teaching ability.
* Even though today is Election Day I am *not* working a polling place today.  I had to stand down for this election on account of being a college professor.  Originally the class I'm currently teaching was going to be meeting on Tuesdays and Thursdays which would've conflicted with my being a precinct election officer.  At the last minute we shifted to class meeting Mondays and Wednesdays but it was too late for me to serve at a polling place.
* I'm not looking forward to the outcome of the poll.  I'll likely be watching [the state-level tracker for state rep seats](https://liveresults.ohiosos.gov/) to see if Kathy Zappitello wins.
* Making progress on weight loss plans is still a goal.  Whether it is [one calculator](https://www.nasmbwpcalculator.com/) or [another](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp) I have to move forward.
* I am still learning more about the INTJ mess.  It explains quite a few things.  
* I will be enjoying *The Mads Are Back* in lieu of fretting over election results with the network news live coverage Tuesday night.  I already voted early.  I'm expecting results to be weird as it is.
* I'm getting to the point of not wanting to plan all that far ahead.  I can't really say that I am taking life day-by-day but planning more than a week ahead is getting increasingly counterproductive.  A time for reassessment is coming.
