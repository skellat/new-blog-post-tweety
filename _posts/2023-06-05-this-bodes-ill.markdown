Sometimes we need to highlight posts from the fediverse.  This will be a bit of a string of images plus text.

Well, folks can find Nextcloud at <https://nextcloud.com> and the VoIP provider <https://voip.ms/> exists too.  Posteo is out there at <https://posteo.de/en> and QNAP sells all sorts of products at <https://www.qnap.com/en-us>.  For those who need to migrate away from the Alphabet empire this frankly would be a decent start.  Getting past using Android would still be a bit of an issue, though.

We'll see what happens down the pike, I suppose.
