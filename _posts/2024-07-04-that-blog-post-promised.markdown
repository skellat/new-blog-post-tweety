I said I would write a blog post for Alan and Stuart about an interesting conundrum in our political situation here in the USA.  After all, this is a horrific mess here.  Although people are calling for Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential contest it frankly is not that simple.

You have to first start by understanding that *there is no single presidential election* in the United States of America.  It is a multiple step process that takes place under fifty different election systems that don't match one hundred percent.  We the people *do not* directly elect the President of the United States.

Primary elections are an invention that came about in the 1850s in a town called Meadville, Pennsylvania.  As you might imagine, Meadville isn't all that far from Ashtabula.  Primaries were not commonly used for presidential elections until [after World War II](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/a-brief-history-of-presidential-primaries) if the National Constitution Center is to be believed.  At a primary election for most offices you have members of a party choosing who they want to be the party's standard bearer in the general election later that year.  A person can win a primary by default through being unopposed as I did back when I made my run for city council in 2021.

Presidential primaries are a little different.  People don't vote to choose a candidate.  They vote to choose delegates to a national convention and those delegates are *pledged* to a particular candidate.  Through party rules those delegates must reflect the wishes of the voters that elected them.  In theory they *can* go rogue and do whatever they want which results in what are term convention floor fights.

Under the Democratic Party's current rules the vast majority of the delegates for this cycle's convention are pledged to Joe Biden.  Unless he releases them from their pledge to him *they will vote for him* at the convention.  A delegate that fails to do so will simply be ousted and replaced with someone more compliant.  The only way the party could force him out would be to totally change its rules right before the convention to allow all the delegates to renege on their pledges.

There are some drastic problems if Biden gets ousted as the candidate.  Under campaign finance law he *cannot* give the money he's raised to anyone but Kamala Harris since they are joint candidates.  If Vice President Harris was pushed aside in favor of some other Democratic Party nominee who had their own pick for Vice Presidential candidate then that new candidate would not see a dime of the campaign dollars raised by the Biden-Harris campaign.  Raising almost a billion dollars over the course of just a few days to try to fill that gap would be insanely difficult especially considering the not insignificant matter of contribution limits on the part of donors that may already be reached.

There's also the problem of optics.  If Biden is forced to step aside as a candidate for election due to age and/or infirmity there is a serious question as to how on earth would he still be fit to serve as President of the United States for the remainder of his term.  If he stepped aside as a candidate he would basically need to resign as President of the United States to avoid scandal.  A resignation would have to take place in the fashion prescribed by law in [3 USC 20](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title3-section20&num=0&edition=prelim) if it in fact happened.  Vice President Harris would succeed to the presidency at that point and would need to appoint a new Vice President per [the 2nd section of the 25th amendment to the United States Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-25/).

In short, there's no practical way Joe Biden is getting ousted as the candidate.  It would lead to chaos if he backed out on his own.  Whether we like it or not, he's the choice of the Democratic Party at large.  He shouldn't have been a candidate at all in this cycle in my view.

To quote Donald Rumsfeld in pertinent part: "As you know, you go to war with the army you have, not the army you might want or wish to have at a later time."

Unless Joe Biden gets really, really sick or passes away he's what we have for a major party candidate standing against Donald Trump.  That's a very bad situation.  It is what we have, though.
