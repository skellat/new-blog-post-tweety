![Post by jwz. "Unfrozen Caveman OpSec Confession Time: - Back in the Twentieth Century, before passwordless sudo was commonly available, every machine that I used had a setuid-root copy of /bin/sh called "cmon" (so I could type "cmon !!") - I used the same two-character password on literally hundreds of web sites. As far as I know, none of them were ever compromised, not even nerd-rage crap like Slashdot. - When I needed a "real" password, it would never require two hands to touch type."

I thought I would be totally gobsmacked by this yet then I remembered the old mainframe I used in one job.  There were a ton of password limitations because the mainframe was still in use for years after its End of Life and I think it is still in use today.  It is a miracle that that thing remains secure.
