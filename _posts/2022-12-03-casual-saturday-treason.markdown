Rick Hasen highlights the big problem over on [Election Law Blog](https://electionlawblog.org/?p=133491) noting that Donald Trump is calling for the Constitution to be suspended.  This was in a post Mr. Trump [made to his account on Truth Social](http://web.archive.org/web/20221203171848/https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/109449803240069864).  For the avoidance of doubt I will restate the text of his post before commenting on it and it said:

  >*So, with the revelation of MASSIVE & WIDESPREAD FRAUD & DECEPTION in working closely with Big Tech Companies, the DNC, & the Democrat Party, do you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT and declare the RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have a NEW ELECTION? A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution. Our great “Founders” did not want, and would not condone, False & Fraudulent Elections!*

The key problem is in the sentence which states:

  >*A Massive Fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.*

There is no way to construe that in an innocent fashion.  This is not [hyperbole](http://web.archive.org/web/20221203220850/https://twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/1599105374086258688?s=20&t=RM6FZujmSnUdnEG9LYJr_Q) at this point.  Even if this man says he's shooting his mouth off there are lots of people around the country who take things like that social media post as *gospel writ*.  We already saw during the Capitol Insurrection that his words can very well translate into actions.

It has already been suggested by someone else that I look for work in Ireland.  It does seem like things are turning in bad directions.  My paternal great-grandfather came to this country in the early twentieth century.  Blazing a new trail in the twenty-first century would not necessarily be revolutionary.

![Above a screencap of the post by Donald Trump to Truth Social, Bill Kristol tweets: "House Republicans revere the Constitution so much they're going to read it aloud at the first session of the new House. Perhaps they could first take a moment to criticize and denounce this dangerous anti-Constitutional appeal by a man they've defended, supported, and cheered on?"]({{site.url}}/img/kristol-tweet.jpeg) [(original post)](http://web.archive.org/web/20221203223518/https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1599161590829711362)
