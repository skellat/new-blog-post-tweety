I'll apparently be attending a symposium at Cleveland Clinic [later this month](https://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/live/courses/pten2023/).  It will be an all-day event on a Monday down in University Circle.  It should be a quite interesting event that I will be attending *in-person*.

There'll be an open webinar hosted by Penn State [dealing with an introduction to ChatGPT for educators](https://networks.h-net.org/node/14775/discussions/12565541/h-teach-online-program-introduction-chatgpt).  I'm signed up for that event and look forward to it.  How we handle ChatGPT in the classroom at the college is a hot topic right now.

Microsoft has an event on the 16th about [reinventing work by using AI](https://news.microsoft.com/reinventing-productivity/).  What could possibly go wrong?  It was reported by *The Verge* that [it is supposed to be revealed at this event that ChatGPT is going to be incorporated into Microsoft's office suite](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/10/23593980/microsoft-bing-chatgpt-ai-teams-outlook-integration).  That could impact the subject matter I teach, oddly enough.

At some point I have "Lunch and Learn Webinar Series: Recent Developments in US Foreign Relations Law and Research Strategies" to attend online courtesy the [Law Library at Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/research-centers/law-library-of-congress/researcher-resources/legal-research-institute/united-states-law-webinars/?loclr=bloglaw).  That actually will be fun.  I miss being a librarian.  I used to be one of the people conducting bibliographic instruction not a faculty requester of it.

Is this an idiosyncratic mix?  Yes.  Bear in mind that the mix of events listed in the community calendar in *The* (Jefferson, Ohio) *Gazette*  on Wednesday listed only fish fry and pancake breakfast events.  Unfortunately *The Star Beacon* is still shrinking on page count and I haven't been able to justify picking up a copy at the current price for so few pages of content to look for e.

I am anchored to northeast Ohio for the time being with the only real options of other places to live [being Melbourne in Australia and somewhere in the Netherlands](https://www.ptenresearch.org/for-researchers-and-professionals/projects-and-publications/).  I have to work within the limits of my available resources.  As much as I might do better elsewhere, it appears many alternative living locations are presently foreclosed as options to me.
