This is a miscellany of brief items in no particular order.  These are done from time to time on this blog.  These are generally things that I want to express but am not ready to make a complete blog post out of them.

In no particular order:

+ I'll be seeing another medical specialist soon.
  + I feel like a lab rat
  + Getting enrolled in a research study kinda makes things feel that way
  + When it comes to a matter with a *known* population incidence of "1 in 200,000" I can't really duck such studies
  + We are learning that there are many modern secular miracles in medicine
+ My current batch of students will be done on June 5th.  My next batch starts 15 days later.
  + No, I am not a drill instructor.
  + My students learn about computers and gain skills in using them.  I'm doing something right.
  + I have to do a new "introducing your faculty member" video to post to Blackboard so that I can swap out the old one.
  + I need to try to author more SCORM content as we head into the summer.
+ The podcasts tracker is updated at <https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/Podcasting>
  + Things that are "private" or "members" feeds do *not* appear in the tracker
  + I suppose that means I should reveal myself as a Patreon supporter of the [Late Night Linux](https://latenightlinux.com/about/) family of programs, I suppose.
+ Life has gotten weird
+ More strangeness is yet to come, I presume
