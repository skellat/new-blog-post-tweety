I'm really getting doubtful of the efficacy of returning to teach this semester.  We just saw *Clarkesworld* have to slam its submissions window shut indefinitely [due to a crapflood of ChatGPT-generated submissions](http://web.archive.org/web/20230222022224/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/sci-fi-becomes-real-as-renowned-magazine-closes-submissions-due-to-ai-writers/).  At Johns Hopkins there is an article posted [that is optimistic about the use of ChatGPT in education](http://web.archive.org/web/20230222055340/https://hub.jhu.edu/2023/02/20/chatgpt-in-higher-education-discussion/) though it reads like wishcasting to me.  There are more stories about Microsoft's instance of ChatGPT being welded to Bing that [is acting unhinged](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/technology/microsoft-sets-new-limits-on-bing-chatgpt-to-prevent-unhinged-behavior/ar-AA17M0Nu).  All in all, this is becoming a rather fast moving target that I am going to have trouble settling on how to teach.

Is AI explicitly in my course objective laid down by the curriculum committee?  No, it is not.  With Microsoft incorporating AI increasingly into its products I know have to incorporate discussion of AI since it is a feature of the software I am teaching about.  Yes, getting to teach students about Microsoft Word is great as it helps enable them in their community college studies.  Figuring out how to teach them ethical and responsible use of the ChatGPT bot that Microsoft will be welding into Word shortly is a tremendous challenge when things are not even completely settled.

Yeah, I am openly expressing doubts *now*.  With luck I will figure out what I am doing.  Time will tell, though...
