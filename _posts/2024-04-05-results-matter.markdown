Well, another batch of test results came in.  This whole week has been a week of examinations and testing.  Frankly I am not surprised that one of the tests came back *again* with me below the normal reference range.  It does mean that when I get to see my general practitioner next week we're going to have an interesting talk.

Fortunately we did not end up finding {REDACTED} during the full body examination.  That would've just been too exciting at the moment, I think.
