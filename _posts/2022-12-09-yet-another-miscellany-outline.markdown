In no particular order:

* It appears [mas.to](https://mas.to) was down last night.
  * I have no clue *why* the [Mastodon](https://popey.com/blog/2022/11/find-your-twitter-friends-on-mastodon/) instance was down.
  * I could shift to another instance.
    * There are plenty out there
    * It is already hard to choose where to be
  * I lack the patience to attempt to self-host at this time.
    * The efforts by [Alan Pope](https://mastodon.social/@popey) show that it takes quite a bit of work.
    * Having [a static site weblog](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Static_site_generator&oldid=1125711762) is more my speed right now
* Thursday was road trip day to Erie
  * Got some background check work done
  * Got some [Christmas shopping](https://stores.barnesandnoble.com/store/2572) done
    * Everybody is getting books this year
    * I bought fiction for family
  * The food was good at [the Chinese buffet on Peach Street near the junction with Interstate Route 90](https://www.sssuperbuffet.com/)
* I can tell I have been writing too much LaTeX coding when I get nervous about typing an ampersand or dollar sign.  Escaping special characters is not really necessary in Markdown but is in other markup languages potentially.
* Our hospitalization numbers in Ashtabula County for COVID-19 are starting to trend upwards.  That's not good.
* The press release about Christmas Eve services at Geneva Church of Christ should go out Friday at some point.
* No, my sermon for Sunday morning is still not written.
* I had almost forgotten I had participated in the SantaThing event of the [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/) community.  There may be one or more books on their way to me.
* I need to figure out what is wrong with the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) install on my MacBook Pro M1.
* Even though the [candidate requirements guide](https://www.ohiosos.gov/globalassets/publications/election/2023_crg.pdf) has been posted by the Secretary of State I do not think I will try running.  The only things that are up this time are school board seats, the at-large seats on Ashtabula City Council, and township offices.
