Well, one of the county commissioners and the current county auditor are [recorded in *The Star Beacon*](https://www.starbeacon.com/news/local_news/local-officials-react-to-trump-verdict/article_a354f58c-1ed0-11ef-99d7-bf64dc900a28.html) shooting their mouths off about Trump.  Yeah, they both claimed that the "true verdict" will come in November in the presidential general election.  That's the biggest bunch of malarkey.  Trump is a felon *now*.

Things like that make me more worried about how Trump supporters are going to react to this.  Sentencing is currently set for July 11th.  That'll be just a few days before the Republican National Convention.  My state senator happens to be a Trump delegate to RNC 2024 and is quoted in *The Star Beacon* saying that a travesty of justice has occurred in Trump's case and that [hellacious retribution is coming](https://archive.ph/GlNMF).  It doesn't help that the junior federal senator from Ohio, J.D. Vance, has already called upon Attorney General of the United Sttes Merrick Garland to investigate the judge, prosecutors, and I believe also the jury in the case against Trump relative to deprivation of Trump's rights.
