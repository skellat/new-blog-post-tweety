What am I actually tracking in my podcatcher at the moment?  Doing blog posts listing things like this has been a popular thing in the moment as far as I have seen.  I suppose I can provide such a list [although you can directly track such via git](https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/Podcasting).
