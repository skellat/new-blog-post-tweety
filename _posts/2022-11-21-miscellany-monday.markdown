In no particular order:

* There is some sort of holiday later this week, I suppose.
  * I am still teaching this week
  * I am still teaching Wednesday night
* Increasingly I end up convinced that Gerry Anderson's vision of the future is what our world is converging towards in far too many ways.
  * The Antonov An-225 leaves me wondering when exactly *Thunderbirds* first aired in the Soviet Union, for example.
  * We're less than 40 years away from the time when the story of *Thunderbirds* and *Stingray* was said to take place.
* I'm not happy about the "Content Warning" drama in Mastodon land.
  * While I was writing this in Visual Studio Code it automatically offered to open a GitHub Issue for me, strangely enough.
  * In the end, my personal settings on [mas.to](https://mas.to/) expand all such taggings by default.
    * I can survive looking at such things usually.
    * It annoys me heavily having to click through all of them to get at content.  That drove me back to Twitter when the "Content Warning" banners got way too excessive.
  *  Either this will pass eventually or there will be a schism.  My money is on a schism.
* I am trying out share buttons on my Jekyll pages.  Hopefully it works okay.
* It is still cold and messy outside.  This climate is not great for me.
