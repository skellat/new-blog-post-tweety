Today is a federal holiday when we remember the terrible events of September 11, 2001.  Unfortunately we now have some elected lunatics in the United States House of Representatives.

I am at a loss.  The calls for secession aren't new.  There were calls in 2021 after the US Capitol Riot according to [*The Hill*](http://web.archive.org/web/20230604235034/https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/arts-culture/563221-shocking-poll-finds-many-americans-now-want-to/).  There were talks of it before the 2021 US Capitol Riot [according to POLITICO](http://web.archive.org/web/20230516215201/https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/21/secession-donald-trump-449348).  There is even correlation between stolen election belief and desire for secession [if one poll is to be believed](http://web.archive.org/web/20230214165556/https://victory-insights.com/files/TX_Secession_Poll_OFFICIAL.pdf).  Representative Greene has been beating the drum for this for a while herself [as noted in this article in *The Atlantic* from roughly seven months ago](http://web.archive.org/web/20230710173859/https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-secession-civil-war/673142/).

We are now **19 days** away from the flashpoint of a government shutdown.  Speaker McCarthy has a working majority of 4 which means he is almost but not quite gelded when it comes to finishing up appropriations.  Folks like Marjorie Taylor Greene dragged out the election of a Speaker of the House to take fifteen rounds.  Does anyone seriously think she won't drag out a government shutdown?  She's part of the group [threatening to do so if they don't get their way and be able to at least start an impeachment inquiry of President Biden](http://web.archive.org/web/20230911213350/https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/11/politics/impeachment-government-shutdown-house-return/index.html).  

No, I don't think things are going to be okay.  Things are going to be a bit of a mess soon.  None of this is required to be this way.
