In no particular order:

+ For all the protests to the contrary, Mr. Trump seems to be trying very hard for set pieces [that look like Leni Riefenstahl set them up](https://web.archive.org/web/20240103053551/https://substack.com/@deanobeidallah/note/c-46469043?r=2k3po)
+ People are getting ready to approach Stripe over extremist content on Substack [according to a post seen there](https://web.archive.org/web/20240103054921/https://substack.com/@noahberlatsky/note/c-46498513) which means we might see Substack either change or start to disappear
+ Platformer is looking to [abandon Substack if it doesn't dump the extremist content](https://web.archive.org/web/20240103055409/https://substack.com/@thehandbasket/note/c-46497901)
+ I probably should participate in the [1928 public domain game jam](https://web.archive.org/web/20240103021523/https://itch.io/jam/gaming-like-its-1928) with something analog
+ I might only really care about *Star Trek Discovery* and *Orphan Black: Echoes* in [this round-up from Polygon of coming TV shows this calendar year](https://web.archive.org/web/20240102174045/https://www.polygon.com/24007774/best-new-tv-2024-release-calendar-schedule-shows-series)
+ I'm not due back at campus until February 1st according to the last dispatch received
+ I need to do a better job of not keeping multiple blog posts clogged up locally and remembering to actually commiting and pushing to GitHub so that Actions can build the static site so it is accessible via GitHub Pages
+ I probably should start an online RPG group so I can get better practice for doing tabletop exercises with my students in class
  + I do have a paid account on Roll20
  + I do have *some* creative skill available
+ Things are just getting weird in these start days of the year
