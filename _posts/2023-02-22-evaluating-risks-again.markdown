![Post by Dr. Lucky Tran. "It's important to say that higher risk people deserve joy too! They deserve to participate in the full range of public life.

What defines someone being in the "high risk" population for COVID-19?  The updated list from CDC is available at <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html>.  I won't say how much I score on that chart.  I *will* say that it is not a happy chart to look at.

I don't need to worry about having a social life, I think.  Thankfully there aren't many ways to **have** a social life here.
