Sometimes strange and disturbing things can pop up in my timeline.  Quoting @edbott@mastodon.social: <https://mastodon.social/@edbott/110255826613482357> #retoot:

![Post by Ed Bott. "DA Fani Willis in a letter to the  Fulton County sheriff: "I will be announcing charging decisions resulting from this investigation during Fulton County Superior Court's fourth term of court, which will begin on July 11, 2023, and conclude on September 1, 2023. ... This correspondence as notice to ... prepare the Sheriff's Office and coordinate with local, state and federal agencies to ensure that our law enforcement community is ready to protect the public." ajc.com/politics/trump-probe-dâ€¦" Posted on Apr 24, 2023 at 17:06]({{site.url}}/img/ed-bott-bad-news-summer.jpg)

Of course, a major propagandist for the person likely to be indicted just got fired by his television network.  It doesn't help [that he's getting job offers from Russian propaganda channels](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-to-tucker-carlson-run-for-president-visit-moscow-2023-4).  Now people are going to be question for years if that propagandist was a plant by that foreign power.

What a royal mess...
