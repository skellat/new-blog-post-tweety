The natural history registry study being led by the PTEN Foundation down in Alabama has some interesting numbers.  Mind you, it has some self-selection problems.  Top countries with identified patients dealing with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome include: United States of America, Canada, Italy, United Kingdom, Australia, and Brazil.  The most experienced doctors in terms of dealing with the syndrome are based in **Cleveland, Ohio**.  

I know it is popular to think about running away from the dumpster fire that is the USA lately.  There aren't many routes that I could take.  Milan is out as I don't speak Italian.  Brasilia is out as I don't speak Portuguese.  Toronto, Melbourne, and Soton are kinda possible yet somewhat high risk routes.

What a mess this is, right now...
