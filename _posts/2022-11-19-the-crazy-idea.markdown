Well, that's frankly rather disturbing.  Mr. Musk really wants to appeal to a core audience of craziness.  Keeping the Trump dream alive definitely resonates with part of the economy, perhaps.  It is part of the economy I truly do not want to take part in.  The former president has done so many wild things that the Justice Department brought in a former war crimes prosecutor who handled cases *from Kosovo* to handle the January 6th and classified documents investigations.  Wouldn't a reasonable person think that perhaps that's a clue that we may be dealing with a supervillain here?

That screenshot was from the middle of the afternoon on Saturday.  Later on Saturday this popped up on my Apple Watch:

We're seeing bad things happen now!
