This is going to a busier week that I had originally planned.  Hopefully I manage everything.  There is plenty to be done.  Leaving time for creative works will be essential this week.  Keeping my nose to the metaphorical grind stone is not a really, really good idea whatsoever.

When it rains, it pours, eh?
