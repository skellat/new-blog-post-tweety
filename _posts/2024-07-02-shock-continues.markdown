I know Dalton said in the chat that he thought we would be able to endure this mess as a country.  Experience as a civil servant gives me knowledge he doesn't have.  Unfortunately it is knowledge *I can't share openly*.

I have bad memories of some of the crap that was attempted during the Trump years.  I remember the various legal battles trying to determine whether orders were actually legal or not.  Far too often the weather headquarters was sending over illegal orders in the beginning that we had to ignore.  Now?  Between the immunity opinion and the absolute power of pardon that the presidency has, frankly legality has been chucked out the window.  The executive branch becomes the plaything of whoever the president happens to be.  That can't be a correct outcome.

Yes, I understand that [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is planning to press forward with impeachment](https://news.yahoo.com/news/aoc-says-shell-file-articles-190630498.html) relative to the justices of the Supreme Court.  I doubt this would go anywhere.  She needs a majority and with Republicans in lockstep support of Trump she won't be able to peel off enough of them to get the votes to pass an impeachment resolution.

Family was shocked Monday when they heard me talking about participating in protests potentially.  Yes, this is that bad of an outcome.

Something broke in our country on January 6th, 2021.  As much as we have tried to blow it off and downplay what happened that day, that damage remains.  Did the autogolpe actually end that day?  With a decision like this it would seem like it simply went into the background for a while and then returned.  With Trump talking about the J6 convicts as being *patriot warriors* he may attempt a rerun of the action.  With his sentencing coming up on July 11th I would expect outbreaks of violence if he gets a custodial sentence.

As a country we never dealt with the trauma of J6.  As the ship is sinking around us we are still trying very hard to act like everything is okay.  It isn't.  The world's direction is very, very wrong right now.  We have metaphorical front row seats to the coming chaos.

That's enough doom and gloom for now.  I can probably sleep more easily with this off my chest now.
