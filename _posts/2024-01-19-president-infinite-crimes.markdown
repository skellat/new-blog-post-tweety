Yes, we are living in a brutal mash-up between a John Ringo novel and a Tom Kratman novel.

I understand the man is desperate and is trying for any defense possible.  He's essentially throwing everything against the wall to see what sticks.  The rant archived above is sheer lunacy in our legal system, though.  No public official is absolutely immune for anything.  This is an argument that would give the office of President of the United States permission to commit infinite crimes without any accountability.

I give full credit to Nick Catoggio at The Dispatch for coining "President Infinite Crimes".  I'm just having a bit of a time picturing what the graphic novel "President Super Villain & The Infinite Crimes Caper" might look like.  It doesn't sound pretty.

We'll see what erupts, eh?
