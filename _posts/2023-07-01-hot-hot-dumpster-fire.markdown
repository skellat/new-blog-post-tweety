Twitter has been a bit of a disaster today.  I think they finally crossed the line to where they're unable to recover.  Heck, we even have Miguel de Icaza mocking the situation today.  Quoting @Migueldeicaza@mastodon.social: <https://mastodon.social/@Migueldeicaza/110640558213734258> #retoot

Then, of course, we find that this rate limit situation is a bit more ridiculous then we thought it might be.  Quoting @cspam@mastodon.cloud: <https://mastodon.cloud/@cspam/110640655005932828> #retoot

Of course, some people thought instability like this was coming.  Quoting @Pwnallthethings@mastodon.social: <https://mastodon.social/@Pwnallthethings/110640380771469469> #retoot

In short, it seems like Twitter is approaching self-destruction.  Mr. Musk is currently [restricting user access](https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/twitter-not-loading-elon-musk-announces-limits-posts-users-can-read-1235659936/) for the supposed reason of fending off "data scraping" to fuel large language model AI systems.  The reason I am saying that that is supposed is that a contract with Google also had to be renewed on Friday and it is questionable if Twitter managed to pay its bills on time.  Systems that were on Google Cloud Engine may be not functioning correctly and thereby leading to cascading errors that bring us to this point.  

This situation did not have to happen...
