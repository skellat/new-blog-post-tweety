In no particular order:

+ I know people think I am being overblown about my local Trump craziness.  [Comparing Trump to the prophets of the Old Testament](https://archive.ph/QA0rL) is certainly a new one for me and it scares the crap out of me.  Terry Wolcott is *a retired preacher* and he's saying stuff like this.
+ Apparently you can deep-link to thngs on Tubi now such as [Women's Sports Network](https://tubitv.com/live/692073/women-s-sports-network)
+ For the non-US folk that I've talked to about wanting to flee the oncoming chaos here in the Americas, it seems like I am dithering.  I should note that I kinda need to be [near an appropriate expert center listed on Orphanet](https://www.orpha.net/en/expert-centres/centres/201?name=Cowden%20Syndrome&consulting=both&age=adult&official=0) wherever I might flee to.  That severely limits the number of *viable* options.  Where is the closest expert center to me here in the land of gun nuts and mad cultists?  Oddly enough it is in Cleveland just a short drive to my west of roughly an hour's length where my doctors are already coordinating as to my care.
