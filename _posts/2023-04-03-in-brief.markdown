* I have about a week left before I begin teaching another section of class.  At the college we break each semester into two eight week sessions.  I did not have any students to teach during the first eight weeks.  My syllabus re-write is not complete yet.

* I realized recently that there are *some* positives to the COVID-19 crisis.  One of them is that the cost of genomic sequencing has gone down rather drastically compared to pre-pandemic times.  Researchers looking into [this particular genetic mess](https://ptenfoundation.org/what-is-pten/) have a much easier time catching it now that it doesn't cost nearly as much to do the testing.  Population level testing could even be possible now to hunt down this problem to study it better thanks to the cost reduction caused by the pandemic.

* When it comes to writing, I need to get back to writing some fiction.  The world around me has basically gone mad.  Writing decent fiction is a good way to channel efforts in coping with the craziness around me.
