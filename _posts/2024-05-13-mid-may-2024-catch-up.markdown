In no particular order:

+ Online teaching is still kicking my butt.
+ I made the first attempt at reaching out to start arranging a bolthole.
+ My personal schedule is not in alignment with the world around me.
+ Certain aspects of a "normal life" are foreclosed to me and that's very hard emotionally to grapple with no matter how easily I may seem to take it intellectually.
+ Life just feels very weird in a world gone mad.
