In no particular order:

+ I wrote a letter to the editor that seems to have run in *The Star Beacon*.  I got the timing of events wrong, it appears.  The events did in fact happen.  I just couldn't hammer down the correct dates.  Yes, the matter I was writing about was simply that bad of a fiasco that I thought it happened across a shorter timeframe than it actually did.
+ Further medical tests lead to further medical results.  The results have gone in directions that were unexpected.  The results aren't that amusing, either.
