In no particular order:

* Apparently I will be preaching in February.  Topic is to be determined.  We don't even have a theme for the month yet!
* We'll be doing a sunrise service for Easter.  This will be interesting.
* Work continues as to how to build up a local streaming television service.  We have plenty of talent and experience locally in Ashtabula County.  We lack *funding* and *production space*.
* We've been having intermittent network failures in the local broadband.
  * This hasn't been confined to just Windstream.
  * Even my mobile broadband over the air with AT&T has been having trouble locally.
  * This hasn't made much sense.
    * Generally the infrrastructure has been working okay locally
    * We're getting into winter collapses through lack of attention, it seems
  * Building for contingency plans is probably a good idea
    * I do suppose I need to do better in monitoring [the 9th District USCG marine weather broadcast](https://www.weather.gov/marine/uscg_broadcasts) and the [various NOAA charts being transmitted by radio station NMF in Boston](https://ocean.weather.gov/shtml/atlsch.php)
      * Reception of the "Cleveland-area" NOAA Weather Radio transmitter is rather rough [based upon its coverage map](https://www.weather.gov/nwr/sites?site=KHB59) as it doesn't really cover Ashtabula
      * Reception of the NWR transmitter in Erie is easier [according to its coverage map](https://www.weather.gov/nwr/sites?site=KEC58)
    * At the very least I *can* ensure reception of weather data is doable.
    * Yeah, I'll need to take a harder look at [John Goerzen's idea for "Building an Asynchronous, Internet-Optional Instant Messaging System"](https://www.complete.org/building-an-asynchronous-internet-optional-instant-messaging-system/)
      * This means messing with [LoRa](https://www.complete.org/lora/) potentially
      * The addition of FRS band radios in the house shows that we already have some ["Tools for Communicating Offline and in Difficult Circumstances"](https://www.complete.org/tools-for-communicating-offline-and-in-difficult-circumstances/)
      * I may have to look at the use of [Yggradsil](https://www.complete.org/yggdrasil/) too
* Waiting on the medical testing news is getting trying.
  * Plans for ife are on hold until tests are back.
  * Results from tests could change the course of life decisions, unfortunately.
  * While I am fortunate that there are world class doctors at Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals of Cleveland, the need to be near them keeps me tethered to northeast Ohio.  When some of those doctors are leading experts in the world on issues that are of possibly vital importance to me frankly I can't leave the area.
  * I'm not sure where I'd relocate to at this point.  Toronto has satellite facilities of Cleveland Clinic there.  There are also satellite facilities in Abu Dhabi and the capital of the United Kingdom.  CCF focuses on being a global powerhouse for medical care.
* I've paused the dating app and canceled the subscription
  * There were no viable hits in it
  * The only responses I got were from women *located in Canada*
  * It just bothered me greatly that I could not get the time of day from anybody in northeast Ohio or northwest Pennsylvania but yet could match with people in southwest Ontario
  * The app is based on a radius *as the crow flies*.  Even at a **50 miles** setting it would still bring in part of southwestern Ontario in addition to northeastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania.
  * Once I pick six possibilities to try my luck with next, I'll roll the dice with [Dice by PCalc](https://www.pcalc.com/dice/) and see where random chance leads me in terms of picking a different dating app to try.
* What a strange world we live in these days...
