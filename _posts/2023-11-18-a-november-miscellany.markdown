In no particular order:

+ Considering my paternal family history, what happens when the United States of America becomes "the old country" some day?
  + The "old country" as it is now *does not presently exist* as a country
  + The community still exists on a map
  + The territory of that community of origin is now located within the jurisdiction of a power rather hostile to the United States of America
  + Yes, this does mean that my surname is an **Americanization**
+ I've got a speaking outline started for the event at [Harbor-Topky Memorial Library](https://www.harbortopky.lib.oh.us) on November 30th
  + I'll be speaking about streaming television
  + The event is intended to be educational and is geared to the general public
  + While [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org) is nice it is *out of scope* for the discussion as I have to focus on commercial, off the shelf solutions
+ A TTRPG thing may be started at Harbor-Topky in the new year
  + It might involve [*Candela Obscura*](https://darringtonpress.com/candela/)
  + It might involve something brewed up using [hack100](https://hack100rpg.com)
  + Development of this plan is needed
+ I need to tame my inboxes
  + Yes, inboxes
  + Although I have used [mutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutt_(email_client)) there are various third-party e-mail provider platforms that do not play nice with mutt which means I would need to work harder to consolidate things
  + I've been pruning subscriptions and it hasn't been working well
+ Thanksgiving is set to be weird
  + Some family will be traveling to Indiana to visit with other family
  + I have to teach class on Thanksgiving Eve in Erie so travel is ruled out for me
  + No, I cannot cancel class that night
  + I will be teaching even if I have only one or two students show up
  + The cat, dog, and I will be spending the holiday together I think
+ The Testing Battery
  + The last test in the battery is coming up on November 27th
  + After that test we'll finally have a bit of a baseline established
    + Much of this testing filters back to a natural history study
    + There are not many other cases to compare against out there, alas
  + A new round of surveillance tests would then pick up in April 2024
    + Not all tests would take place again
    + Some tests would not have to take place again for a minimum of 3 years
+ Dating and relationships
  + Pretty much a dead letter
  + The test on November 27th may be the last nail in the coffin on that front
  + While it might not be good for a human to be alone I may be in a bit of a bizarre position in life
  + Do I want to get into "unequal yokes" and the complications of invisible struggles that people have?  No, not really
+ I have no clue what is coming
+ The slate is looking *somewhat* clear for the state of 2024
+ Site evaluations need to resume so I can find a better bolthole
  + In this instance, a "bolthole" is a fallback position to bug out to if things are getting ridiculous
  + There are medical concerns that play into those considerations
+ What is next?
  + I have no clue
  + Contingency plans need to be readied
  + I may take some time off from teaching depending upon how things turn out with this last medical test
  + Overall, I'll be tied down a bit here at home
