Well, after I submit my grades I am done teaching for hte year.  That'll be five regular semesters of teaching on the books plus two summer semesters.  After all the *sturm und drang* of undergraduate and graduate school who would have thought that *THIS* was where I needed to be in life?

The only major event that I have coming up is the Christmas Eve service at Geneva Church of Christ.  I may actually be on stage as part of the praise team singing that night.  Usualy I am in the back handling tech matters so it would be a nice switch.

I will be needing to working on some curriculum things between now and the start of the spring semester.  Thankfully the spring semester doesn't start until February.  That's an artifact of all the COVID waves and us trying to avoid starting classes in the middle of them.  That gives me time to get ready to teach the new classes in the spring that I haven't taught before.

I do intend to visit <https://startplaying.games> to see about finding a pickup game or two.  I need to take a break and relax.  More than likely I would be looking for something in the realm of [Traveller](https://startplaying.games/search?gameSystems=traveller) or [Cyberpunk](https://startplaying.games/search?gameSystems=cyberpunk-2020&gameSystems=cyberpunk-red).  I would not be averse to something from the realm of the [Tiny D6 system](https://startplaying.games/search?gameSystems=tiny-cthulhu&gameSystems=tiny-dungeon&gameSystems=tiny-supers) even though it is a bit more obscure.

The planning to flee continues.  The question of [passports](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Passport&oldid=9380185) is still being worked on even though the matter of [seeking asylum](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees&oldid=9477226) grows simpler with nominees like [the Secretary-designate of Health and Human Services](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.&oldid=9916838) who are dangerous to people with various medical conditions.

This is not how I wanted this year to end.  We'll see how things go, I suppose.
