Some days I wish we had the [Trumpy](https://youtu.be/cW-5qrwsiOI) from MST3K.  Saturday was one of those days.  Donald Trump was [ranting online that he thinks he will be arrested on Tuesday the 21st](https://web.archive.org/web/20230319044058/https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-idCAKBN2VK07I).  He called for his supported to protest across the country so as to protect him.  The district attorney in Manhattan [has already made his reply to Trump's ranting](https://web.archive.org/web/20230319042422/https://www.politico.com/news/2023/03/18/manhattan-da-bragg-privately-warns-on-intimidation-threats-to-rule-of-law-00087745) by indicating that the DA's office will not be intimidated.  The head of the House Republican Conference, Elise Stefanik, [made remarks on Twitter supporting Trump](https://web.archive.org/web/20230319045107/https://twitter.com/elisestefanik/status/1637126158809538563).

I just have a bad feeling about this.  I was alive when the [Waco siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waco_siege&oldid=1145378099) and the [Ruby Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ruby_Ridge&oldid=1145007827) incidents took place.  This situation could degenerate into being a siege in Florida pretty quickly.  There is reporting that [supports of Donald Trump are planning to mobilize as human shields to protect him physically from being arrested](https://web.archive.org/web/20230319045658/https://www.thedailybeast.com/officials-prep-for-protests-as-maga-sycophants-push-patriot-moat-around-mar-a-lago).  That's the sort of behavior you'd expect from people involved in that tragedy in Waco.

Things are getting scary right now...
