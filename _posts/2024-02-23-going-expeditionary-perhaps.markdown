Well, it appears that my current Mastodon host is going down.  There will be *some* time before that happens, though.  This means I have some time to figure out where to bounce to.  

The problem is determining *where* to go.  

There are many servers with many rules sets.  Many of them are fairly restrictive.  I've been having trouble finding open general sites lately.  

Do I need to stick around in the Mastodon end of the Fediverse?  I don't know.  

There are many things I don't know lately.
