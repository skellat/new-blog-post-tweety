Well, all that remains are two more class meetings to teach this semester.  I have heard nothing about teaching in the spring semester.  The spring semester doesn't start until *February* so it could be some time before I hear anything definitive in that situation.  I shouild not set aside projects that come up if I don't get clarity from the school.

What projects might arise?  That is uncertain and undefined.
