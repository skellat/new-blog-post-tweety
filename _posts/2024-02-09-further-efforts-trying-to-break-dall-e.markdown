The prompt:

>*Cree indigenous women dressed in neon-trim full body armor, neon-trim tactical pants, & neon-trim combat boots are hiking down a dirt road of ruins in Kentucky. The scene looks like a warrior march featuring these small yet lean women. These young women have wildly different hairstyles. These muscle-bulked athletes have very visible muscles and are at their peaks of genetic development. They appear disheveled yet feminine in this new post-apocalyptic cyberpunk dystopia.*

The picture:

That was created using Microsoft Copilot Designer.  

Let's rerun the prompt using Google Gemini.  What on earth would that get you?  These are the four images generated:

As an effort in trying to induce "model collapse", the prompt was developed with judicious use of LLaVa via llamafile.  The [Self-Cannibalizing AI](https://media.ccc.de/v/37c3-12125-self-cannibalizing_ai) presentation from 37c3 is a very good inspiration.  This is just interesting seeing how complicated I can get the prompts to be and how the rendering of those prompts reflects the biases of the developers of the models.  Introducing internal contradictory elements to prompts makes their processing really, really interesting.

We have to live with Generative AI but is Generative AI ready to live with us?
