I will simply note that I have been listening to the [podcast of Critical Role](https://critrole.com/podcast/) and watching [episodes of *The Legends of Vox Machina*](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Legend_of_Vox_Machina&oldid=1139537661).  Why?  This gives me ideas for [exercise design and analysis](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-120.c&lang=en).  The two endeavors overlap quite a bit.

What would I be putting exercises together for?  That's a good question.  The Congressional Budget Office [says the federal government will run out of cash somewhere between July and September](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/15/us-treasury-default-debt-ceiling) *if not sooner* due to shortfalls in tax revenues.  That'll be the big question in collections.  If companies increase the pace of layoffs the amount of money being sent to Treasury via withholdings would inevitably decrease.  If layoffs keep going we're more likely to see the federal government run out of money closer to July than September, if not sooner.

Yeah, preparation for contingencies is *still* needed...
