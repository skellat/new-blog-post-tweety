Now that the term is done I can watch some recorded materials from PAX East 2024 perhaps.  Such items could include:

+ [Code, Sweat, and Cheers: How we Made Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty | PAX East 2024](https://youtu.be/-_AIOjGyHgs)  
+ [Metroid: A Community Retrospective and Look Toward the Future | PAX East 2024](https://youtu.be/Yr1UJAdXfIM)  

Then perhaps from Southern California Linux Expo:

+ [Citizen Science in Libraries: Bridging the Gap Between Communities and Science](https://youtu.be/4xHUvDaRFs4)  
+ [Create a First AI Program with TypeScript and Serverless WebAssembly](https://youtu.be/BoNrIx93vZE)  
+ [So you want to build an Incident Response stack using OpenTelemetry?](https://youtu.be/2byIS8wsoxA)  
+ [Measuring Local Government Investments in Arts and Culture: Why an Open Data Approach Matters](https://youtu.be/6mGmRoq6tWE)  

Then perhaps from the Hydraulic Press Channel:

+ [Crushing Propane Cylinders with Hydraulic Press](https://youtu.be/EvWXq7rOlTo)  
+ [Easter special with hydraulic press](https://youtu.be/9qipt0yUKt8)  

What could go wrong?  With all the horrible political news I do think the crushed propane cylinders may wind up on repeat.  After all, the cult leader is [selling King James Version translation Protestant Bibles with additional materials included](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/donald-trump-is-selling-60-bibles-as-he-seeks-funds-for-for-campaign-legal-bills/ar-BB1kzJMI)...
