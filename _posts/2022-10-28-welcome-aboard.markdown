This is the initial blog post to get this blog up and running.  Why is this even being done?  Frankly we're in a weird time in America.  Elon Musk just consummated his takover of Twitter.  If things get too screwy there I **will** abandon the place and just switch to blogging.  

For now I am using Netlify for hosting.  I hope I don't regret doing this.  We'll see what erupts, I suppose.
