This weekend we get to undertake the barbaric ritual known as changing the clocks for Daylight Saving Time.  America has tried permanent daylight saving time before and it didn't work yet there is a push to try it once again.  During the brief time I lived in American Samoa I was blessed with not having to worry about the Daylight Saving Time switch as the territory didn't and still does not observe it thanks to being located near the equator.

In many respects I miss living in American Samoa and want to move back.  The roughly equal dayparts of darkness and light were one of the benefits of being out there.  Unfortunately the level of care available at LBJ Tropical Medical Center pales in comparison to that provided by Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals of Cleveland so staying here in northeast Ohio remains a better idea at this time.
