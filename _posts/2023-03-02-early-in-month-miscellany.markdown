This is another miscellany of various items.  In no particular order:

* Thanks to [Prime Premiere](https://www.primepremiere.amazon/) I went down to Valley View to watch in an actual movie theater the premiere of [Daisy Jones and the Six](https://www.amazon.com/Daisy-Jones-Six-Teaser/dp/B0B8NS22S2/).  The episodes of the show that were shown were interesting.  Having seen Imogen Waterhouse in [The Outpost](https://www.electricnow.tv/node/295) it was very strange to see her older sister Suki in something.  They look very alike although Suki is taller than Imogen.  Suki plays the role of a keyboardist in *Daisy Jones*.  Imogen was merely the queen of the realm in *The Outpost*.
* We are enjoying [*The Ark*](https://www.electricnow.tv/shows/ark) courtesy Electric Now at home.  It is a great show.  I was **not** going to sign up for Peacock just to be able to see the show via SyFy.  I'd much rather pay the producers directly.
* I am going to be spending time researching [prevailing wage rates](https://flcdatacenter.com/) for a variety of jobs.  I know people locally have very skewed perceptions as to value, price, and cost.  In planning to build a streaming video operations I would end up having to pay prevailing market rates *at a minimum* to recruit staff.  If anything I would have a premium on the prevailing rates as this area would be considered a hardship station.  Average hourly pay for a cameraman in the northeast Ohio market is USD$20.22.  There is research to be done.
* The *Star Beacon* is getting even thinner.  It is now averaging two sections of six broadsheet pages each.  The next step down from that would be to produce only a single section of eight pages.  From there it could collapse further to a single section of only four pages.  The problem with these shrinking print editions is that there is no concurrent increase in online material.  Output is down overall at the title.  I don't know what CNHI is up to but we'll be lucky if the *Beacon* survives the year.
* The dating project has been left by the wayside for the time being.  As much as I want to pursue it I have let it slip in the priorities.  It will be pursued again at some point in the year ahead.
* No deal in sight on the federal government's debt ceiling means that I have to start being very careful in how I schedule things.  Nothing major should be scheduled after June 5th for the time being.  That's simply being on the safe side right now.  If the federal budget breaks I don't want to be caught in a mess yet again.  I still have not so happy memories of the 35 day shutdown that kicked off in 2018.
