We're looking at a future that has less stable connections than we've otherwise known.  It is strongly suggested people begin to gain familiarity and proficiency in the use of [NNCP](https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/) which is a successor to [UUCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UUCP&oldid=1146511468).  Other tools may become even more useful as time goes by.  The current paradigm may not stay as stable as we would like it to be.
