This is going to a busier week that I had originally planned. Hopefully
I manage everything. There is plenty to be done. Leaving time for
creative works will be essential this week. Keeping my nose to the
metaphorical grind stone is not a really, really good idea whatsoever.

When it rains, it pours, eh?
