The world is getting very messy. In Ohio we have an attempt in progress
to convert higher education on the part of the state-owned institutions
into something that looks far more like the nightmare created by Ron
DeSantis in Florida. The imposition of ``culture war'' legislation on
the state-owned part of the higher ed world in Ohio just boggles me.

A new letter to the editor in \emph{The Star Beacon} has someone saying
that \href{https://archive.ph/wPiK2}{electing Donald Trump is our
country's best hope}. There is quite the clash of worldviews right now.
People want to fight the culture war here. That does not lead to peace.

There are other nasty things in the legislative text section of the
state operating budget that just got handed off to Governor Mike DeWine
for consideration. There is no indication as to what exactly he'll do. I
can only hope for line-item vetoes. Much of this garbage cannot be
allowed to stand.
