Well, the first attempt at posting a weather report
\href{https://coyote.works/2023/weather-report-for-january-11.html}{did
not look so hot}. We had an issue with filming an actual presenter in
front of the DIY green screen. We simply did not have enough lighting to
have that person lit.

I have the automation scripting
\href{https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/show-prep-scripts}{posted
to Launchpad} that I keep iterating development upon. It is by no means
perfect. It \emph{should} reduce some of the fiddly bits involved in
making this happen, I think.

A big problem in doing this is that my ``office'' at home is pretty
small. There really is not much room to work in. Other than swapping out
the really cheap webcam being used I need to get an alternate location
to use. I have no funding to pay rent for a commercial space, though.
That means a fundraiser may need to come sooner rather than later.

I should sleep on how all this played out and write more in the daylight
Thursday. The constraints we have are rough but there has to be a way to
pull this off. I just haven't found it yet.
