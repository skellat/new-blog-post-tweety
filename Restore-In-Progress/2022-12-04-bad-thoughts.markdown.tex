In this situation currently I'm looking at a bit of a mess. We literally
have a former president calling for a dictatorship. That's not just my
assessment but one shared by others such as

Cox Richardson}.

What do we do with this? This guy \emph{cannot} blow off steam. When he
says incendiary things people wind up acting on them. How else did the
Capitol Insurrection occur?

I already had someone tell me to look for work in Ireland. There may be
\href{https://www.churchofchrist.ie/}{one} or
\href{https://thechurchofchrist.ie/}{two} resources to look at in that
regard. What they're seeing develop out here in the USA pretty much has
happened before in Europe. It isn't pretty.

A big question is if this is going to be like 1990s Bosnia or 1930s
Germany. History gets ignored at our peril.
