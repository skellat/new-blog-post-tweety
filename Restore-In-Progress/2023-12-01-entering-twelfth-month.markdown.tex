The presentation at Harbor-Topky Memorial Library Thursday night went
well. There was a technical mishap that prevented filming the event. My
PC laptop crapped out in terms of the USB host controller, it seems. The
laptop otherwise functions but trying to hook up a peripheral will be a
lost cause.

I had more attendees than I expected. That was a good thing. The
interesting bit will be whether or not such things happen again in the
future. With no assignments at the educational institution set for 2024
yet I might try to add events with less of a commute to my calendar.
