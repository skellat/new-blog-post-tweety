What am I actually tracking in my podcatcher at the moment? Doing blog
posts listing things like this has been a popular thing in the moment as
far as I have seen. I suppose I can provide such a list
\href{https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/Podcasting}{although you
can directly track such via git}.

In no particular order:
