Now for my reaction to all this! At present, I don't have a way to push
my own transcript using \href{https://www.acast.com}{Acast}. Presently I
am listening to podcasts using \href{https://overcast.fm}{Overcast}
instead of Apple's stock podcast app. Why use Overcast? It is easier to
keep podcast listening in sync between my tablet, phone, laptop, and
smartwatch.

Do I listen to podcasts from my smartwatch alone using a Bluetooth
headset connected to the smartwatch? Yes, I do. Walking the chihuahua in
the park is a good example of that. Using the treadmill at home is also
a good example. The stock Apple podcast app for my watch was just too
clumsy and cumbersome to use while Overwatch does what I want it to do
with far less hassle.

Are they using a Whisper-like LLM to do this transcription work? That's
the big unknown to this. Whisper is not perfect. It also might have
problems listening to \href{https://69admins.com}{69 Admins} to be able
to come up with \emph{good} transcript results.
