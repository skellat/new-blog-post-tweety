In no particular order:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I eventually need to get my sermon written for preaching on December
  31st at Geneva Church of Christ.
\item
  I've received an exciting offer that I have confusing feelings about.
  I still said yes to it, though.
\item
  I didn't realize the Census Bureau now has county profiles
  \href{https://data.census.gov/profile/Ashtabula_County,_Ohio?g=050XX00US39007}{such
  as one for Ashtabula County}.
\item
  The stats from Census about
  \href{https://data.census.gov/vizwidget?g=050XX00US39007&infoSection=Disability}{adults
  with disabilities in our county} are disturbing. The overall picture
  of the county's health situation seen in the
  \href{https://www.cdc.gov/places/about/index.html}{PLACES
  visualization from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}
  doesn't look great either.
\item
  The worship planning meeting on Saturday morning has things mostly
  arranged to get us through the end of the year operationally.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We won't be doing a Christmas Eve service this year
  \item
    We won't be doing a Christmas Day service this year
  \item
    Easter is going to be at the end of March 2024 and that'll be the
    next major service we end up planning
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Petey is getting more stubborn on walks.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Petey is a stubborn chihuahua
  \item
    The dog is my main walking partner
  \item
    I think he's expecting snow that hasn't shown up \emph{yet}\\
  \item
    Walking on the old treadmill is \emph{boring}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The marriage question keeps popping up

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    No, I don't have a good answer as to why I am not married
  \item
    The constant promotion of the ``Marriage Pact'' reality show is
    probably what prompted the asking of the questions
  \item
    I've kinda given up looking for the time being as I \emph{still}
    have interesting scary things to learn when I visit the doctor's
    office each time I visit
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I know not what 2024 brings

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Anything can happen, really
  \item
    I suspect there will be outbreaks of violence somewhere that will be
    election-related
  \item
    We will quite probably all be learning the mechanics of the 12th
    Amendment next year as to what a ``contingency election'' looks like
    which hasn't happened in this country since 1824
  \item
    There will be separatists trying hard to crack the country up
  \item
    ``AI'' is likely to go in weird directions
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Christmas may be weird if I don't finish a few things up
\end{itemize}
