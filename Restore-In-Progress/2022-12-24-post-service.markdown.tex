We had eleven visitors out of the thirty-nine people attending the
Christmas Eve service at Geneva Church of Christ. With all the nasty
weather we frankly weren't expecting more than four to five people.
Other churches on Ohio Route 534 between Ohio Route 84 and United States
Route 20 abandoned their Christmas Eve service plans yet we just kept on
trucking. The replay is available \href{https://youtu.be/6GkQTMBJPq4}{on
YouTube} primarily.

There is still a regular Sunday morning service happening on Christmas
Day. I will be presiding over communion during the service even! With
luck we figure out the problem with the audio before the start of the
service tomorrow so that folks on the live stream do not have issues.

The weather outside is still a mess. It isn't a good situation when
Interstate Route 90 is safer and easier to travel on in contrast to
United States Route 20. We're getting \emph{new} lake effect snowfall
tonight to add to the mess we've already received. This has limited my
exposure to the outside world as might be imagined.

According to the forecast we'll have to wait until we get into 2023 for
things to thaw out slightly. More nastiness could still come down the
pike, though.
