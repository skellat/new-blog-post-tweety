It appears that a shotcast geared towards my rural community of
Ashtabula County might be worthwhile to pursue. I remember the olden
days when Shot of Jaq was still a live podcast that had a per-episode
runtime generally not exceeding \textbf{ten minutes}. What would the
topic be? How to do cord-cutting in a challenged environment like this.
There are many aspects to doing so here that would never be considered
in a more built-up area.

A fortnightly release frequency may work, perhaps. We'll see if this
could be launched before Easter. The resources \emph{are} there to do
this, I think.
