I am finding that \href{https://github.com/dvehrs/podget}{podget} makes
a very good tool for a central downloading system for podccasts. Why
have a single system downloading podcasts in the home? Well, we've been
having turbulence with our broadband yet again. It is better to download
once and then copy to mobile devices to be played using
\href{http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-appletv.html}{one version} of
VLC or \href{http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html}{another}.

Of course, an ``Always Free'' virtual machine in one cloud or another is
running the same thing as a backup. No, it isn't pretty. I also do a lot
of commuting lately. If we hit a contingency of not having home
broadband service for an extended period I would theoretically still be
able to reach the VM from somewhere else on the road.

Now, if I get \href{http://www.nncpgo.org/}{NNCP Go} hooked up to this
then some really interesting things become possible\ldots{}
