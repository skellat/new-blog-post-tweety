I praise the Lord for giving us things like
\href{https://bigfinish.com/}{Big Finish Productions} in our world.
Listening to dramas from
\href{https://www.bigfinish.com/collections/v/the-worlds-of-gerry-anderson}{The
Worlds of Gerry Anderson} as well as
\href{https://www.bigfinish.com/hubs/v/doctor-who}{Doctor Who} makes the
drive from home to the employer that much more tolerable. It is
definitely a shorter distance to get to this site compared to the other
two but I'm still traveling about 40 miles \emph{one-way}.

Duty went far better than I expected it would this morning. \{REDACTED\}

One of my absolute favorite romps from Big Finish is their
\href{https://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/v/space-1999}{Space: 1999}
revival. I highly recommend it. It does \emph{not} mimic the storylines
entirely of the original television series. It was part of a great round
of stories to listen to during the fall round of commuting.

As odd as it may seem for this blog there actually can be good news at
times.
