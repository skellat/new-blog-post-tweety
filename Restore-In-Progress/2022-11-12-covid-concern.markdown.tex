Ashtabula County is now 84th in the nation out of all three thousand one
hundred and forty three counties in the United States for hospital
admissions due to COVID-19 over the last week. Our vaccine uptake is
abysmal compared to other areas. With BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 taking off it
seems like winter will be nasty.

In terms of hospital admissions last week the top six counties are all
northeastern Ohio counties. Starting from Ashtabula as number six you
then have Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Mahoning, and Trumbull. I know people
claim we're in a post-COVID age but even with the resources of
University Hospitals of Cleveland and the Cleveland Clinic locally we're
still in not so great shape.

Ashtabula County had its ``red sweep'' at the polls on Election Day. The
correlation between outcomes like that and vaccine refusal is
disturbing. Unfortunately there are consequences and we may not be able
to dodge them this time.
