There is a bit of a tension in place. The date the Secretary of the
Treasury is using as the tentative target for when the federal
government runs out of money
\href{https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1196}{is June
5th}. Ohio Capitol Journal reported this morning that
\href{https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/02/16/u-s-likely-to-default-on-debt-between-july-and-september-unless-congress-acts-cbo-says/}{the
Congressional Budget Office expects cash to run out between July and
September}. There are some unknowns that we frankly have to wait on yet.

Collections are going to be key. If federal tax revenues go haywire then
we might not make it to the optimistic projections of the CBO. With all
the layoffs that have been announced there have basically been many,
many streams of tax revenue cut off from Treasury as withholdings will
not longer be paid forward. As an entire industry has been engaged in
retrenchment we'll be seeing folks not necessarily back in the workforce
actively all that quickly. That \textbf{will} impact collections. More
people wanting ``collections alternatives'' taken on their tax accounts
would also starve the federal beast of revenues and times of layoffs
like these are typically when such requests proliferate.

Yeah, I have to make some financial moves. I'm looking at some pain
coming.
