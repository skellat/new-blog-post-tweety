It is more than likely this will seem like a stream of consciousness. In
no particular order:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  The letter to the editor in \emph{The Gazette} ran Wednesday about
  straming video services in Ashtabula County. The idea is out there
  now. We just need to take it to execution.
\item
  The weather is frightful. Most of my fitness activities involve being
  \emph{outside}. It is a little too treacherous to be outside right now
  even with boots, gloves, and coat. I don't like this.
\item
  There are now more than 230 feeds in the
  \href{https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/FeedReadingFeeds}{tracking
  repository} if people want to find a new RSS feed to follow.
\item
  The podcast feeds list
  \href{https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/Podcasting}{is updated
  and has odd items in it}, I suppose.
\item
  Part of the grand plan for 2023 was that various vendor certifications
  would be pursued such as those from
  \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/}{Microsoft}
  and \href{https://training.apple.com/it}{Apple}. That fell to the
  wayside due to unexpected contingencies arising. I may yet get back to
  it.
\item
  Change is needed in how my life is going. How that may happen is
  unknown.
\end{itemize}
