  It appears \href{https://mas.to}{mas.to} was down last night.

    I have no clue \emph{why} the
    \href{https://popey.com/blog/2022/11/find-your-twitter-friends-on-mastodon/}{Mastodon}
    instance was down.
  \item
    I could shift to another instance.

    \item
      There are plenty out there
    \item
      It is already hard to choose where to be
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    I lack the patience to attempt to self-host at this time.

    \item
      The efforts by \href{https://mastodon.social/@popey}{Alan Pope}
      show that it takes quite a bit of work.
    \item
      Having
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Static_site_generator&oldid=1125711762}{a
      static site weblog} is more my speed right now

    Got some background check work done
  \item
    Got some
    \href{https://stores.barnesandnoble.com/store/2572}{Christmas
    shopping} done

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Everybody is getting books this year
    \item
      I bought fiction for family
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    The food was good at \href{https://www.sssuperbuffet.com/}{the
    Chinese buffet on Peach Street near the junction with Interstate
    Route 90}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I can tell I have been writing too much LaTeX coding when I get
  nervous about typing an ampersand or dollar sign. Escaping special
  characters is not really necessary in Markdown but is in other markup
  languages potentially.
\item
  Our hospitalization numbers in Ashtabula County for COVID-19 are
  starting to trend upwards. That's not good.
\item
  The press release about Christmas Eve services at Geneva Church of
  Christ should go out Friday at some point.
\item
  No, my sermon for Sunday morning is still not written.
\item
  I had almost forgotten I had participated in the SantaThing event of
  the \href{https://www.librarything.com/}{LibraryThing} community.
  There may be one or more books on their way to me.
\item
  I need to figure out what is wrong with the
  \href{https://flutter.dev}{Flutter} install on my MacBook Pro M1.
\item
  Even though the
  \href{https://www.ohiosos.gov/globalassets/publications/election/2023_crg.pdf}{candidate
  requirements guide} has been posted by the Secretary of State I do not
  think I will try running. The only things that are up this time are
  school board seats, the at-large seats on Ashtabula City Council, and
  township offices.
