It is going to be a fabulous day starting off teaching for the spring
semester today. It would be even better if I could \emph{sleep} a bit
before I have to teach in the daylight. I'll have to sign off soon.

I think I have everything in readiness. The jitters are what's keeping
me up. These always happen, it seems.
