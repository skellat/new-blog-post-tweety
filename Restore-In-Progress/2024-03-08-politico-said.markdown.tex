Politico mentioned about last night's State of the Union address that
Donald Trump was making a post storm over on Truth Social. A problem
arose in terms of connectivity somewhere along the line. That resulted
in totally decontextualized posts standing alone at points. Via

The folks at \emph{The Dispatch} published an editorial headlined
\href{https://thedispatch.com/article/the-american-people-deserve-better/}{The
American People Should Demand Better}. For the most part I agree with
the editorial. I go beyond it as saying that we need a third choice. Two
angry ancient men are hardly wise choices to lead the republic. We need
a viable third choice that isn't a lunatic anti-vaxx person that helped
cause a measles epidemic in Western Samoa, for example.

This is going to be a year of excitement in ways none of us truly want,
it seems.
