Well, there is a
\href{https://patreon.com/erielookingproductions?utm_medium=unknown&utm_source=join_link&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=copyLink}{Patreon
creator account} established.

Why do this? Well, backup contingency plans are always useful to have in
place. I have no security of tenure in the work that I am doing right
now in the ``day job'' so it can disappear at any time.

What sort of things would I be creating in such a circumstance? Well, I
have a running file of story ideas that I haven't fully developed yet.
Some of it looks sci-fi and some of it looks quite absurd. Writing and
then typesetting using the \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/novel}{novel class
on CTAN} would allow for pursuing various publishing routes. Of course,
the \href{https://github.com/rallg/novel}{repo on GitHub for ``novel''}
claims that its use is becoming discourage and that a new class will
become available any day now. I did make three things that I published
using Amazon KDP and the novel class. Using the
\href{https://ctan.org/pkg/newspaper}{newspaper class on CTAN} might
allow for publishing short fiction on a recurring basis too.
