There is not as much certainty in life right as I would like. I did get
\emph{some} small degree of certainty on Thursday morning when some

doctors. The problem is that they're not exactly minor or benign issues.
Life will be going in some new directions now, I suppose.

If the news is any indication I may not be the only one seeing new
directions ahead, I guess\ldots{}
