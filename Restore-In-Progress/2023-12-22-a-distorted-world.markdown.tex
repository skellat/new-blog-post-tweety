With as crazy as it was today at both
\href{https://www.gianteagle.com}{Giant Eagle} and
\href{https://www.marcs.com}{Marc's}, you'd think people were losing
their minds. What are they reacting to? Are they expecting some sort of
apocalypse where we'll fall backwards in terms of technological state?
That is to say, something that looks like this:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{\%7B\%7Bsite.url\%7D\%7D/img/planfor2024.jpg}}
\caption{AI-generated picture that LLaVa generates the following
hallucinatory description stating: ``The image features two beautiful
women standing in a field, posing for the camera. Both of them are
wearing green and blue tops that showcase their toned bodies. One woman
is holding an open book while they pose together, adding interest to the
scene. In addition to these elements, there's also another smaller
figure visible on the left side of the image but it appears less
prominent in comparison with the main subjects.'' There is no smaller
figure, though.}
\end{figure}

Yeah, that would be a kinder and gentler outcome that stories like
\emph{The 100} never quite reached.

I have my suspicions as to what was causing the weird behavior earlier
today but I'm going to keep them to myself. I don't like where those
suspicions lead.
