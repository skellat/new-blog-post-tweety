Is Donald Trump going to be indicted Tuesday? It is very weird for the
target of an indictment to know the date and time they'll be arrested.
It is most likely that \emph{nothing} will happen in terms of him being
arrested or not on Tuesday. It is likely, though, that the various
cultists will spark protests and riots across the country.

There are several investigations by different jurisdictions that could
lead to Donald Trump being indicted. In many respects it just boils down
to waiting for somebody to go first. Unfortunately Mr.~Trump has been a
very bad boy quite possibly with prosecutors in multiple states plus the
federal government considering credible charges.

Why would he even post what he did? It primarily stirs up the
disinformation/misinformation machine. It was a preemptive strike
against law enforcement in this country. If he could deligitimize his
prosecution in any way he would most certainly try. It looks like he did
so by trying to frame the situation as a vendetta against him instead of
the wheels of justice turning more slowly than usual.

This is not a good place to be standing as a country. We can't let this
go on and letting the madness go on is detrimental. Getting out of this
mess isn't going to be easy, alas.
