The operations plan for setting up locally produced ``television'' for
the Ashtabula area is mostly written now. I have to do some final edits
but later on Wednesday may see it being sent to people. Hopefully I can
gain some support to actually launch the project in January 2023. It
looks like
\href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-business-premium?activetab=pivot\%3aoverviewtab}{Microsoft
365 Business Premium} plus
\href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/microsoft-teams-phone\#office-InlineSkuChooser-b423wnv}{Microsoft
Teams Phones} will be needed to make things work in addition to webcams,
video cameras, microphones, and other gear.

There is a need to fill as our ``local'' television in Cleveland has a
territory to serve that equals the size of the commonwealth of
Massachusetts. We're the largest county by territory in the state. Our
county's territory is nearly the size of Rhode Island's territory. We
need our own news coverage to cover our local area on our own.
