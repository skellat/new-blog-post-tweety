In no particular order:

  Considering my paternal family history, what happens when the United
  States of America becomes ``the old country'' some day?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The ``old country'' as it is now \emph{does not presently exist} as
    a country
  \item
    The community still exists on a map
  \item
    The territory of that community of origin is now located within the
    jurisdiction of a power rather hostile to the United States of
    America
  \item
    Yes, this does mean that my surname is an \textbf{Americanization}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I've got a speaking outline started for the event at
  \href{https://www.harbortopky.lib.oh.us}{Harbor-Topky Memorial
  Library} on November 30th

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I'll be speaking about streaming television
  \item
    The event is intended to be educational and is geared to the general
    public
  \item
    While \href{https://www.mythtv.org}{MythTV} is nice it is \emph{out
    of scope} for the discussion as I have to focus on commercial, off
    the shelf solutions
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A TTRPG thing may be started at Harbor-Topky in the new year

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It might involve
    \href{https://darringtonpress.com/candela/}{\emph{Candela Obscura}}
  \item
    It might involve something brewed up using
    \href{https://hack100rpg.com}{hack100}
  \item
    Development of this plan is needed
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I need to tame my inboxes

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Yes, inboxes
  \item
    Although I have used
    \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutt_(email_client)}{mutt} there
    are various third-party e-mail provider platforms that do not play
    nice with mutt which means I would need to work harder to
    consolidate things
  \item
    I've been pruning subscriptions and it hasn't been working well
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Thanksgiving is set to be weird

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Some family will be traveling to Indiana to visit with other family
  \item
    I have to teach class on Thanksgiving Eve in Erie so travel is ruled
    out for me
  \item
    No, I cannot cancel class that night
  \item
    I will be teaching even if I have only one or two students show up
  \item
    The cat, dog, and I will be spending the holiday together I think
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The Testing Battery

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The last test in the battery is coming up on November 27th
  \item
    After that test we'll finally have a bit of a baseline established

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Much of this testing filters back to a natural history study
    \item
      There are not many other cases to compare against out there, alas
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    A new round of surveillance tests would then pick up in April 2024

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Not all tests would take place again
    \item
      Some tests would not have to take place again for a minimum of 3
      years
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dating and relationships

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Pretty much a dead letter
  \item
    The test on November 27th may be the last nail in the coffin on that
    front
  \item
    While it might not be good for a human to be alone I may be in a bit
    of a bizarre position in life
  \item
    Do I want to get into ``unequal yokes'' and the complications of
    invisible struggles that people have? No, not really
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I have no clue what is coming
\item
  The slate is looking \emph{somewhat} clear for the state of 2024
\item
  Site evaluations need to resume so I can find a better bolthole

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In this instance, a ``bolthole'' is a fallback position to bug out
    to if things are getting ridiculous
  \item
    There are medical concerns that play into those considerations
  \end{itemize}
\item
  What is next?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I have no clue
  \item
    Contingency plans need to be readied
  \item
    I may take some time off from teaching depending upon how things
    turn out with this last medical test
  \item
    Overall, I'll be tied down a bit here at home
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
