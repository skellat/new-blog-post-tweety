I am well aware of the current push to get people off Substack in light
of its problem relative to fascists and neo-nazis. I sympathize with the
goals. That being said, it isn't quite so simple to just walk away.

There are some content sources that are not going to migrate off
Substack that I want to maintain access to. Those content sources are
also not likely well-prepared to simply jump ship. If anything, they
would shutter their operations indefinitely rather than suffer a
migration if push came to shove.

Consider one of those is a continuing course on the study of
disinformation and how to counter it. I think it is counterproductive to
force that instructor to migrate. She's an experienced person with a law
enforcement background. I think she'll be fine. There's no integrated
solution for her to jump to and she's not equipped to self-host. It
would be a disproportionate demand upon the instructor in question to
ask that she shift off Substack to a self-hosted set of tools that are
not clearly defined by anybody at this point as a migration endpoint.

Remember, there are edge cases in life. You need to plan for them. If
you demand that content creators jump ship, what on earth are they to
shift to?

When we get into 2024 I will probably hear then from the instructor of
the disinformation class. She's enjoying the holidays. She's likely
\emph{not} aware of what is going on with the current mess. I should
follow her lead, I think.
