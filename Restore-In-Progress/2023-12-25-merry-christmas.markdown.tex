Merry Christmas!

When I went to bed last night I was hoping we wouldn't end up with an
incident like
\href{https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2020_Nashville_bombing&oldid=8516117}{what
happened in Nashville in 2020}. That's still freaky to me. Even though
it happened in Nashville it ended up causing impacts here in Ohio that
day.

As far as I can tell we're having a quiet day so far.
