On Saturday there was \href{https://69admins.com/2023/episode-7.html}{a
new episode of \emph{69 Admins}} where we continued to talk about rural
perspectives on accessing streaming television. Yeah, accessing such
things is different in places like Ashtabula County compared to bigger
places like Cleveland. I spent a bit of time at the beginning of the
episode talking about material disappearing from online services.
There's an essay on \emph{The Conversation}
\href{https://theconversation.com/streaming-services-are-removing-original-tv-and-films-what-this-means-for-your-favourite-show-and-our-cultural-heritage-208746}{that
takes a look at that issue too}.

I highly recommend reading that essay.
