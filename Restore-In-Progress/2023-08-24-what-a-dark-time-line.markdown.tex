Well, Donald Trump has been booked for the fourth time now this year on
criminal charges. He had to post cash bail. He has bail conditions even.
How long will it be until he screws up and breaks those conditions? At
that point, what do you end do?

Here in Ohio, we have malign influences like Michael Gonidakis showing
up in a political controversy again
\href{https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/08/24/split-ballot-board-approves-reproductive-rights-amendment-summary-written-by-ohio-sec-of-state/}{as
seen in Ohio Capital Journal}. I'm really not sure why people didn't see
this coming. After the huge dirty tricks attempt known as Issue 1 from
the first half of the year there are still worse things to come.

Of course, the weird medical news I got this week has me looking for
boltholes yet again. Sticking around here in Ashtabula County
increasingly looks like a bad idea as the political climate
deteriorates. There is no specific benefit to living in the same county
as where the namesake patient to the rare disorder I'm dealing with was
born back in the 1940s. Of course, I've outlived the namesake patient
thanks to contemporary medicine so there are at least \emph{some} small
blessings.

As much as I want to build an online news outlet to bridge gaps here in
Ashtabula County, this
\href{https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/17/media/facebook-referral-traffic-reliable-sources/index.html}{report
from CNN} makes it seem like it may be too late. Oh well.

Wow, this is a bit rambly\ldots{}
