In light of changing circumstances I have shifted off
\url{https://mas.to} to \url{https://ubuntu.social}. I just shut down
the script on the free tier instance on Oracle Cloud that posts links to
new blog entries. Whatever I did with
\href{https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2toot}{feed2toot} to get credentials
done right is apparently not easily done at this hour of night in
shifting servers. I'll try again when it is light outside.

Yeah, this is a shift. It had been time to shift for a while.
