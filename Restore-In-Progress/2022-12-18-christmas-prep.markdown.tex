Well, we are at the point where the past sixty days have had us at
\textbf{a floor} of ten percent COVID-19 test positivity in Ashtabula
County. This is the general point where things are considered out of
control. Yeah, our case counts are down. Our hospitalizations are up,
though. This puts the validity of our testing numbers in doubt.

Practice happened on Saturday and covered not just today but also
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. I \emph{think} we may be ready. The
livestream will be running during the Christmas Eve service and with the
number of people we have watching regular services it is safe to assume
we'll have higher viewership Saturday night.
