YouTube has become increasingly unwatchable. I get that the ad market is
in not so hot shape. I get that the big push in business these days is
to get recurring revenue through things like subscriptions. That's just
the nature of the beast right now.

Engadget reports that
\href{https://www.engadget.com/youtube-is-taking-its-fight-against-ad-blockers-global-122041223.html}{YouTube
is now on a global campaign to get people to pay for YouTube Premium}. I
don't see the value proposition as being sufficiently compelling to pay
more for watching User Generated Content than I pay per month for
various paid streamers such as PBS Passport and Paramount+. If anything
this pushes me towards possibly having to migrate the

off YouTube to either a
\href{https://vimeo.com/features/livestreaming}{paid streaming resource
like Vimeo} or see about what we can do to stand up an
\href{https://owncast.online}{owncast} instance.

This is yet another part of the tumultuous twenties, it seems\ldots{}
