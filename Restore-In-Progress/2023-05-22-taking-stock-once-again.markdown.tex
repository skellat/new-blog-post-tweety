We're getting down to the wire on the debt ceiling, it seems. The
zealots in the House of Representatives are not going to make this
simple. If they stick to the formalism of having bills posted for 72
hours prior to a vote and if the Senate demands time to read the bill
first then we \emph{practically} have to have a deal done before Friday
to be able to avoid the looming hard deadline of June 1st. It seems
quite uncertain that they're going to manage to get this done.
