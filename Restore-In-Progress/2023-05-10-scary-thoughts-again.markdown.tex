Once upon a time I wound up modifying our streaming strategy at Geneva
Church of Christ. The Russo-Ukrainian War had just started and there was
an expectation that there would be significant disruptions to online
services. We began multi-streaming so that we weren't just streaming to
YouTube. We also streamed to Twitch and Twitter to allow people to watch
our church services. We stopped streaming via Twitter once Elon Musk
bought it on grounds of possible reputational harm due to the antics
that were already happening as the takeover just happened.

When the news pops up that Tucker Carlson is

Twitter} as reported at

I get very concerned. Twitter is starting to become a danger to the
cohesion of the nation. How we address it is going to be a major concern
as time goes by, it seems.
