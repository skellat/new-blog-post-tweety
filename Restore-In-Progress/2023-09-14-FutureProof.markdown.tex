I'm quite possibly looking at a future that has less stable connections
than we've otherwise known. It is strongly suggested people begin to
gain familiarity and proficiency in the use of
\href{https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/}{NNCP} which is a successor to
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UUCP&oldid=1146511468}{UUCP}.
Other tools may become even more useful as time goes by. The current
paradigm may not stay as stable as we would like it to be.

Future-proofing becomes needed due to connectivity failures growing in
regularity. Elon Musk randomly shutting down the entire Starlink
constellation just to prevent an offensive Ukrainian operation against
Russia is definitely an example of arbitrary and capricious connectivity
problems we'll see increasingly in the future. An always-online world is
looking like it is disappearing slowly but surely. It might remain in
the United States \emph{for now} but around the world we see disruptions
increasing.
