It would be a legitimate question to ask what Lauren Weinstein is asking
about. Fortunately the Internet Archive has a great program of capturing
and transcribing television news. A clip from the CBS Evening News
bringing up the situation can be found at

What do I think will happen? Frankly I do not know. In northeast Ohio we
have a little thing known as \emph{winter} that would stop protests and
riots from happening. The forecast is calling for yet more lake effect
snow to be followed by rather cold rains which will freeze and then even
more snow. People won't be out and about protesting and rioting in that
mess in this area. In other areas that don't see snow like we do locally
their mileage may vary.

These interesting times are horrid.
