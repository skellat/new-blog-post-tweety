\caption{Post by Stephen Michael Kellat. ``\,``Why bother?'' That's the
question I end up facing far too often while living here in Ashtabula.
There's quite a bit wrong here. Regardless of how much as I want to make
things more near ``normal'' in this area, there is no drive locally to
do that. People locally like being extremely backwards and far too often
also economically poor. The kool-aid was drunk by many, I think. Many
proudly affirm they follow MAGA belief. When you follow the false idols
of Q and MAGA it leads to bad ends.'' Posted on Mar 24, 2023 at 18:00}

Yeah, I do get upset at points. I gets batted about whether it is
``depression brain'' talking or if it is a reflection of the state of
the ara. For as long as I have been alive it has been a saying that you
set your clocks back twenty years when you cross the county line into
Ashtabula County. Nowadays I would say it isn't twenty but rather thirty
to forty.

The area wants to cling to glory days that are in the continually
receding past. In the county health rankings from the University of
Wisconsin, Ashtabula County is
\href{https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/ohio/ashtabula?year=2022}{among
the very least health counties in Ohio}. Life expectancy here is lower
than not just the national average but the state average too! When you
pull up ``peer counties'' that have similar socioeconomic indicators as
well as demographic indicators the rankings site gives you choices like
these counties across the country:

Some of those are not very happy places. I've worked in at least one of
those counties at an academic institution as temporary faculty. The
listed counties in Ohio are not home to much of anything in particular
that is nationally significant.

If a community doesn't want change then efforts to bring change even if
they are for positive outcomes are seemingly in vain. I'm in the
position of being stuck screaming into the void, basically. With people
locally cheering on book banning, cheering on the notion of the federal
government defaulting on its debt, and other MAGA patent nostrums I end
up wondering if the area is simply lost.

The task at hand is looking for a way forward through this mess, it
seems.
