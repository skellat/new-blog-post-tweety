I will be in the pulpit on Sunday at
\href{https://www.genevachurchofchrist.org/}{Geneva Church of Christ}.
The sermon title is ``Keeping The Story Together'' and is based in
Matthew 11:2-11. We'll be streaming live at 1530 UTC on
\href{https://www.twitch.tv/GenevaChurchOfChrist}{Twitch} and
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs1dDMVsjKcgeOynUXZkZww}{YouTube}.

Service should prove interesting in the morning, I suspect. Dad will be
providing the communion meditation. Amy S will be leading worship and
providing the call to worship. Jerod C will be running projector video
and I can't recall who is covering Sunday. We have a team in place to
make things run smoothly tomorrow.
