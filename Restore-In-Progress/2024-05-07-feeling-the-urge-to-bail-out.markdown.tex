We have RSS feeds, and a YT channel. But we're investigating a home on
PeerTube. Would we potentially be welcome there? Probably just one
channel with all the shows in it, like we do on YT, rather than a
channel per show, but interested to hear your thoughts! üôè'' Posted on

I only just spotted this today. This could explain why I've been looking
at things like migrating
\href{https://www.genevachurchofchrist.org}{Geneva Church of Christ} off
YouTube streaming to something like
\href{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/get-started-with-town-hall-in-microsoft-teams-33baf0c6-0283-4c15-9617-3013e8d4804f}{Microsoft
Teams town halls} or just using
\href{https://vimeo.com/features/livestreaming}{Vimeo}. Google is
flaking out in weird ways. If I trusted the local infrastructure in
Ashtabula County I would be starting an
\href{https://owncast.online}{owncast} node to just be done with it and
manage it ourselves. Unfortunately our local infrastructure is crap and
the closest data center is in
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Youngstown,_Ohio&oldid=1221588283}{Youngstown}.

With all the protests going on across the country as well as at
\href{https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/video/dozens-arrested-after-hunter-college-protesters-try-to-reach-met-gala/}{prominent
events like last night's Met Gala}, I suppose having things like this
locked down \emph{might} be important. Life may wind up disrupted.
Keeping communications open will be important.
