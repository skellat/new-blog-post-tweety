I've modified the site structure a little bit. The front page is only
going to show links to seven posts. The RSS feed will contain
\emph{twenty} posts. Posts aren't being nuked but the idea is to push
things off to the RSS feed so things age off the front of the site.
Scrolling down a front page that seems to be just infinitely scrolling
titles bothers me.

Christmas Eve service at church was announced and planning remains in
progress. I will be likely handling technology that night. A big problem
we have right now is getting audio input to the streaming computer to
stay stable. I'm going to have to hack on that on Thursday morning.

I didn't lose the congregation on Sunday when I was preaching. That's a
good thing. I was surprised to have as many as I did show up.

I'll write more later, I assume.
