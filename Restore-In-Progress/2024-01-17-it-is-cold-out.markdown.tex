It is not a metaphor to say it is cold out right now. The wind chill is
dangerously cold outside. As much as I like exercising through hiking
frankly there is way too much risk at the moment. There is plenty of
treadmill time in my future, it seems.

In the metaphorical sense, that Trump win in Iowa was a bad thing. We're
in an environment where
\href{https://julieroys.com/the-great-dechurching-explores-americas-religious-exodus/}{the
number of dechurched are rising}. People have moved on from saying ``God
Save America'' to ``Trump Save America''. Even though primaries are
already in progress,
\href{https://www.engadget.com/openai-lays-out-its-misinformation-strategy-ahead-of-2024-elections-022549912.html?src=rss}{folks
like OpenAI don't really have plans completely in place to counter
disinformation/misinformation}. There will not be a slow rise of
Mr.~Trump toward securing his party's nomination. Based upon the success
in Iowa, the number of candidates that dropped out, how close his
competitors are to running out of cash, his cult-like followers and a
few other things Mr.~Trump may well have captured the nomination if he
wins next Tuesday in New Hampshire.

A very stupid time is coming if it hasn't already started. An
ostrich-like approach seems to be impossible. I don't like wild rides
like this.
