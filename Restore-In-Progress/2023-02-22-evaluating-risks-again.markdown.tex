\caption{Post by Dr.~Lucky Tran. ``It's important to say that higher
risk people deserve joy too! They deserve to participate in the full
range of public life. That's why masks also make sense in many settings
beyond essential spaces, and why we need to keep trying to reduce
\#COVID spread with other measures such as cleaning indoor air and
developing better vaccines.'' Posted on Feb 21, 2023 at 23:35}

What defines someone being in the ``high risk'' population for COVID-19?
The updated list from CDC is available at
\url{https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/underlyingconditions.html}.
I won't say how much I score on that chart. I \emph{will} say that it is
not a happy chart to look at.

I don't need to worry about having a social life, I think. Thankfully
there aren't many ways to \textbf{have} a social life here.
