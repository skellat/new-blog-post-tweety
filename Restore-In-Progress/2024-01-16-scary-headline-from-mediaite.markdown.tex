\begin{quote}
\emph{Trump fans at an Iowa rally were near-unanimous when asked if
they'd prefer former President Donald Trump as a ``dictator'' over
reelecting President Joe Biden --- one even said ``This country needs a
dictator!'' and another compared Trump to a much-needed ``paddling'' for
the nation.}

I must seriously work harder on getting an escape plan together. My
position is compromised. People are \emph{literally} calling for
dictatorship. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?

The USA had a good 247 year run, I guess.
