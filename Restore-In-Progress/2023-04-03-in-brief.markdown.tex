  I realized recently that there are \emph{some} positives to the
  COVID-19 crisis. One of them is that the cost of genomic sequencing
  has gone down rather drastically compared to pre-pandemic times.
  Researchers looking into
  \href{https://ptenfoundation.org/what-is-pten/}{this particular
  genetic mess} have a much easier time catching it now that it doesn't
  cost nearly as much to do the testing. Population level testing could
  even be possible now to hunt down this problem to study it better
  thanks to the cost reduction caused by the pandemic.

  When it comes to writing, I need to get back to writing some fiction.
  The world around me has basically gone mad. Writing decent fiction is
  a good way to channel efforts in coping with the craziness around me.
