With all the roadblocks to the streaming video operations it seems like
that program may have to be modified significantly. Switching to audio
removes the majority of the roadblocks. The big question, though, is
whether or not people would actually listen to audio show. Monetization
via Acast, Triton Digital, or another provider would be relatively
straightforward.

If I decide to drop the drive toward video I could probably launch a
crowdfunding campaign before Easter for an audio program. I suppose I
could write up a budget for \emph{that}. That'll be enough of a
challenge this week, I suppose.
