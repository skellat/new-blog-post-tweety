A technical issue arose that resulted in a date appearing without a blog
post title. The post didn't correctly appear in the RSS feed either. How
did this happen? Well, YAML blocks can be very bad places to forget
closing quote marks. I forgot one on a post and broke the post. That's
part of the joys of using the jekyll static site generator for blogging.

Regular operations should resume ASAP.
