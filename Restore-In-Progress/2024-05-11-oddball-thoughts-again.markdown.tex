I will dig this small item out of the quarantine grave:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Imagine: \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22970944/}{putting

insulin resistance}.}

Yeah, being in that cohort is not fun. I've heard about ``keto diet''
being one of the somewhat viable ways to manage the matter. The problem
with that is that there are countervailing factors that \emph{may}
prevent adopting such a thing.

Sometimes the complexity in life can be rather odd, I suppose.
