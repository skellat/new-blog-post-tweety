Our local daily newspaper, \href{https://www.starbeacon.com/}{\emph{The
Star Beacon}}, did not release an edition today. According to its
release pattern it \emph{will not} release a paper tomorrow. The last
print edition that dropped was the combined weekend edition that came
out on December 23rd.

As far as I can tell they didn't manage to replace the retiring
reporter. That'll leave them with a reporter, photographer/reporter, and
editor. That's not really enough to keep a daily newspaper functioning.

I'll be very interested in seeing if there is a newspaper edition at all
on Wednesday.
