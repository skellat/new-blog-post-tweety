Well, the economics of television and cinema are going haywire. The
Writer's Guild is heading to a strike quite possibly too. We might see
the airwaves full of unreal ``reality television'' crap in the near
term.

With that in mind I keep thinking back to ``Season 8'' of \emph{Buffy
The Vampire Slayer}. You might be wondering what that might be since
there were only \textbf{seven} seasons on television. The so-called
``Sesaon 8'' was a comic book run led by Joss Whedon. It was used as a
means to wrap up story lines.

For all the television shows getting the axe unceremoniously right now,
is this a possible way to bring some closure to their stories?
Production is expensive and nobody wants to pay for it right now when it
comes to scripted television. Some of these conglomerates have their
hands in print publishing outfits too such as Disney owning Marvel
although they've not really had the cancellation problem that Warner
Brothers Discovery (ultimate owner of DC Comics) has had.

These are tentative thoughts that are not fully developed. Closure to
stories is good. Working through the bizarre state of our economy will
require some creativity to ensure stories still get told.
