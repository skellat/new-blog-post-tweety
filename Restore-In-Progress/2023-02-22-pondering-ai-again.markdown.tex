I'm really getting doubtful of the efficacy of some approaches to this
sort of AI. We just saw \emph{Clarkesworld} have to slam its submissions
window shut indefinitely

to a crapflood of ChatGPT-generated submissions}. At Johns Hopkins there
is an article posted
\href{http://web.archive.org/web/20230222055340/https://hub.jhu.edu/2023/02/20/chatgpt-in-higher-education-discussion/}{that
is optimistic about the use of ChatGPT in education} though it reads
like wishcasting to me. There are more stories about Microsoft's
instance of ChatGPT being welded to Bing that
\href{https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/technology/microsoft-sets-new-limits-on-bing-chatgpt-to-prevent-unhinged-behavior/ar-AA17M0Nu}{is
acting unhinged}. All in all, this is becoming a rather fast moving
target.

Yeah, I am openly expressing doubts \emph{now}. With luck I will figure
out what I am doing. Time will tell, though\ldots{}
