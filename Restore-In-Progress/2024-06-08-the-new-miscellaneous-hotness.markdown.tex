  I know people think I am being overblown about my local Trump
  craziness. \href{https://archive.ph/QA0rL}{Comparing Trump to the
  prophets of the Old Testament} is certainly a new one for me and it
  scares the crap out of me. Terry Wolcott is \emph{a retired preacher}
  and he's saying stuff like this.

  Apparently you can deep-link to items on Tubi now such as

  For the non-US folk that I've talked to about wanting to flee the
  oncoming chaos here in the Americas, it seems like I am dithering. I
  should note that I kinda need to be
  \href{https://www.orpha.net/en/expert-centres/centres/201?name=Cowden\%20Syndrome&consulting=both&age=adult&official=0}{near
  an appropriate expert center listed on Orphanet} wherever I might flee
  to. That severely limits the number of \emph{viable} options. Where is
  the closest expert center to me here in the land of gun nuts and mad
  cultists? Oddly enough it is in Cleveland just a short drive to my
  west of roughly an hour's length where my doctors are already
  coordinating as to my care.
