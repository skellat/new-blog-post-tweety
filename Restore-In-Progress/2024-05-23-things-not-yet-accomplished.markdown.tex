There is software out there known as
\href{https://greenstone.org}{Greenstone Digital Library}. I will
eventually need \href{https://greenstone.org/download}{to get it up and
running} on \emph{something}. It seems like time to start building
appropriately curated collections of digital materials. With all the
crap out there thanks to the AI-fueled crapflood, we're going to need to
have some bastions of reality left standing.
