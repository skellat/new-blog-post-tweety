Well, what a way to start the week. We had quite a bit of rain today
that was torrential at points. Having spread out over a period is okay.
Having a single concentrated blast is a bit hard to handle.

The writer's strike continues and television is getting really crappy.
Between Big Finish Productions and a later day interest in comic books I
may be covered okay. I have a decent set of recent acquisitions that
will keep me busy for a while.

I had written more here but I deleted it. That happens, it seems.
