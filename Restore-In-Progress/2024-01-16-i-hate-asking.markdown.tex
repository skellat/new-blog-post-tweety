I'm going to need help. Our daily newspaper is falling to pieces.
Nothing is there to replace it. As much as I want to try to do
something, I can't. A simple e-mail newsletter won't cut the mustard.
There needs to be a reporting staff and more. There needs to be people
to handle money. There needs to be production people.

I can identify the problem. I'm not the best one to try to fix it. I
most certainly can't fix it \emph{alone}. Asking for help to do so is
extremely hard. There are many, many good reasons to just let things
fail here in Ashtabula since the community seems hell-bent on a
``managed decline'' approach to life.

This is not a good mess to be in.
