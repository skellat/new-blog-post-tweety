Today is not a day for travel. Mind you, the roads really are not all
that plowed still. With three city plow trucks doing racetrack loops
around Main Avenue instead of doing the rest of the city streets Sunday
when we were coming home from church, I don't think the situation is all
that great. Main Avenue is not that big and it doesn't take three big
plow trucks to clear snow unless you're scraping up asphalt too.

Keeping in mind what Alistair Buxton had to say about teletext I intend
to do some experimenting. I really want to move forward on getting some
sort of television programming up. With all the emergency conditions we
had over the weekend and as unreliable as Facebook has proven to be for
disseminating information we need to have \emph{something} in place.

I really do not want to go with the
\href{https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/auto-newspaper}{penny
press newspaper production via LaTeX} plan instead. The code for that is
basically settled as it is. What I \emph{do not} have settled is
production capacity to print a community startup newspaper akin to what
\emph{Zvezda} was trying not all that long ago over in the Russian
Federation. I don't have the seed capital to even start looking at gear
from Konica Minolta at this point let alone other vendors.

We'll see what erupts, eh?
