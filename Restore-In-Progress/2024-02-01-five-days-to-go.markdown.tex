I have to be back on-campus in a bit for kick-off proceedings to start
another semester. This will be the second semester of our third academic
year in operation. Other than not being aboard for the first year of
operations I have been part of the staff since August 2022.

Yesterday the president of the college announced we broke through the
threshold of 500 students being enrolled. That's been a big
psychological barrier for a lot of us. We've been speed-running a lot of
this work getting a community college off the ground and starting nearly
from scratch. On Monday we'll be kicking off our sixth regular semester
of teaching and we have essentially created something good in so little
time.

In the days before COVID, this would've been unheard of. What we've done
would've taken far, far longer. So many barriers that existed previously
aren't there. The environment that we're working in is also rather
different.

I can look and say that I've had a hand in changing lives for the better
and have helped create an institution that will build a community up. My
main regret is that \emph{it isn't in Ohio let alone Ashtabula County}.
I am never really able to do this sort of work in the place where I
dwell (sometimes called ``home'') and usually end up doing it elsewhere.

Yes, there are several hours of meetings to come. They're going to be
exciting ones.
