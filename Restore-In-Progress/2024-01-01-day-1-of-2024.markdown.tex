Starting off a year can be a weird thing. We watched the ball drop in
New York City via the \href{https://abcnews.go.com/Live/}{ABC News Live}
streaming service. Our Internet flickered out during the night while
neighborhood idiots decided to violate local ordinances and set off
fireworks on a fairly densely packed street way too close to overhead
utility lines.

What have I been doing today? Cleaning house, walking the dog, and
trying to find any reporting in the local newspaper. With the retirement
of Shelley Terry at \emph{The Star Beacon} the paper is reduced to
having the vast majority of its ``local news'' written by Warren
Dillaway and the rest of the paper being wire copy and ads. Print copies
of the paper are getting mighty thin.

Today happened to be a holiday so multiple stores were closed and mail
did not run. There really wasn't anywhere in town for me to go other
than the park today. That'll be different on Tuesday perhaps.
