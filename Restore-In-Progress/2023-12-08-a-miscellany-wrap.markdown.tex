  We have a budding dictator

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Yes, we have to honor the threats being uttered by The Old Man
  \item
    There is no way to be dictator for ``one day only''

      Shredding the constitution is shredding the constitution
    \item
      Having absolute power like that is something that cannot be done

    We've got Steve Bannon calling for a

      It is being treated

      This disturbs me greatly

    The man already was involved in one attempt at a coup d'Ã©tat so I
    think frankly he needs to be taken at face value rather than
    discounting these statements as merely attempts to gin up his
    political base

  Weight loss efforts continue but are slow

  I eventually need to get a new passport set

  Christmas is apparently going to be celebrated at home in Ashtabula

  We're looking at staffing loss at \emph{The Star Beacon} and I'm
  getting concerned that they're below acceptable minimums to be able to

    We need a study as to the news seeking behaviors of the local

    The ridiculous part already observed in that regard was when I did
    the ``Smart Streaming Television'' presentation at Harbor-Topky
    Memorial Library

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      People were calling after the event complaining they knew nothing
      about it
    \item
      It ran in \emph{The Star Beacon} and \emph{The Gazette} for over
      \textbf{one month}
    \item
      It was highlighted on the library's Facebook account
    \item
      There was promotional material inside the library and handouts

      What were people expecting? Canvassers?

    I have to buckle down and write up pitches to those two medical
    schools

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Art schools retain life models for their students to draw
    \item
      Would such medical schools be willing to retain a relatively high
      functioning patient with A Rare Condition for students to poke,
      prod, and observe?
    \item
      Family preferences are relocating to Toronto or Brisbane
      for\ldots well\ldots political reasons facing the USA at the
      moment
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    In terms of ``continuity of care'' the possible places I can go are
    very limited
  \item
    The places where people are available that specialize in The Rare
    Condition are simply not that numerous

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Cleveland, Ohio
    \item
      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
    \item
      Boston, Massachusetts

    Unfortunately I am not blessed with being able to just ignore The
