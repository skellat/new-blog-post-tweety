I am shocked and amazed that this works. It wasn't the simplest of
choices to go with a static site. Initially I had thought about using
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ikiwiki&oldid=1012497040}{ikiwiki}
again but couldn't find server space I could both afford and not feel
like I had to do too much fussing with. Changes at Branchable
\href{https://web.archive.org/web/20210815110543/http://www.branchable.com/news/changes_at_Branchable/}{made
it a non-option}.

We'll see how this experiment goes. I may migrate more to this
eventually. Using
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1117046041}{VSCode}
to blog makes this a lot easier than I thought it would be.
