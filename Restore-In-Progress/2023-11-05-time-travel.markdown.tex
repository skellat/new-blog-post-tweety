One of the pitfalls of having a blog in Jekyll is that I sometimes get
the datestamps screwed up. Jekyll won't build posts that are future
dated. After multiple builds were triggered overnight and into today I
couldn't figure out why two posts wouldn't show up. With the seasonal
time switch I also got the date wrong. I added not just an hour to the
UTC offset but also to the day which caused the posts to be future
dated.
