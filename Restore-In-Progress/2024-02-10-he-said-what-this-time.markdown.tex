Says He Might `Encourage' Russia To Attack NATO Allies}

They linked out to a video at
\url{https://www.youtube.com/live/0aRBV2O2WEQ} which I needed to
download just the captions from. I wasn't watching an almost two hour
video of that man ranting and raving. If anything, the report might have
missed something.

The command stanza invoking yt-dlp used in this instance was:

\begin{quote}
\emph{yt-dlp --skip-download --write-auto-subs --embed-subs
--embed-metadata --concurrent-fragments 32 --downloader aria2c
--downloader-args ``-s16 -j16 -x16'' --windows-filenames
--trim-filenames 64 --mtime
``https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aRBV2O2WEQ''}
\end{quote}

The \emph{de facto} transcript in WebVTT form is a horrifying read. The
man is nuts.

Thanks to \href{https://mstdn.social/@kcoyle}{Karen Coyle} for flagging
this mess on Mastodon.
