There is a big election today here in Ohio. Issue 1 relates to abortion
rights being enshrined in the state constitution. Yes, I voted in favor
of Issue 1. I expect passage of the issue statewide. The big question is
whether or not the issue carries passage in Ashtabula County. If it does
pass in Ashtabula County it then raises the question as to just how
Republican this county really is or if the two times Trump carried the
county were \emph{anomalies} in an actually Democrat-trending county.

Results won't be known until fairly late tonight and Internet is still
impaired here at home. What could go wrong?
