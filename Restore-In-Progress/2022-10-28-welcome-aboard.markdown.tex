This is the initial blog post to get this blog up and running. Why is
this even being done? Frankly we're in a weird time in America. Elon
Musk just consummated his takover of Twitter. If things get too screwy
there I \textbf{will} abandon the place and just switch to blogging.

For now I am using Netlify for hosting. I hope I don't regret doing
this. We'll see what erupts, I suppose.
