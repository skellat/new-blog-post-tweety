Well, one of the county commissioners and the current county auditor are
\href{https://www.starbeacon.com/news/local_news/local-officials-react-to-trump-verdict/article_a354f58c-1ed0-11ef-99d7-bf64dc900a28.html}{recorded
in \emph{The Star Beacon}} shooting their mouths off about Trump. Yeah,
they both claimed that the ``true verdict'' will come in November in the
presidential general election. That's the biggest bunch of malarkey.
Trump is a felon \emph{now}.

Things like that make me more worried about how Trump supporters are
going to react to this. Sentencing is currently set for July 11th.
That'll be just a few days before the Republican National Convention. My
state senator happens to be a Trump delegate to RNC 2024 and is quoted
in \emph{The Star Beacon} saying that a travesty of justice has occurred
in Trump's case and that \href{https://archive.ph/GlNMF}{hellacious
retribution is coming}. It doesn't help that the junior federal senator
from Ohio, J.D. Vance, has already called upon Attorney General of the
United States Merrick Garland to investigate the judge, prosecutors, and
I believe also the jury in the case against Trump relative to
deprivation of Trump's rights.
