  We had enough rain to bring the Ashtabula River up to a flood level.
  Where do I normally take Petey to walk? Park spaces in the river gulf!
  Petey has been unhappy walking around the neighborhood so the picky
  chihuahua didn't go anywhere Wednesday.

  Starting the video podcast hit a new roadblock that was unexpected.
  Getting past the roadblock remains a work in progress.
\item
  It looks like I will be digging into launching a crowdfunding effort
  this spring. The
  \href{https://com.ohio.gov/static/documents/2023MWPoster.pdf}{Ohio
  Minimum Wage} is \$10.10 per hour and depending upon where you put
  ``podcaster'' in the classification schema the prevailing hourly wage
  locally starts around
  \href{https://flcdatacenter.com/OesQuickResults.aspx?area=3900002&code=27-4012&year=23&source=1}{\$12.63},
  \href{https://flcdatacenter.com/OesQuickResults.aspx?area=3900002&code=27-2012&year=23&source=1}{\$16.26},
  or
  \href{https://flcdatacenter.com/OesQuickResults.aspx?area=3900002&code=15-1299&year=23&source=1}{\$21.60}.
  Payroll costs are inevitable as this podcasting effort would not be
  possible as a solo project.

  This year is already going in unexpected directions. I'm not quite
  sure where things are headed.
