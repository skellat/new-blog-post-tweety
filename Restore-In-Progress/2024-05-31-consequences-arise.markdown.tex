Well, this may get bad very quickly. He's going to be \emph{persona non
grata} in a whole lotta countries as of now, I think. I don't think any
of the members of the UN really tolerate visits by convicted felons.

A convicted felon as a Head of State is a problem. Why do people want
this loser to be president again? He wasn't exactly all that great as
POTUS last time.
