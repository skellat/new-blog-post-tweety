  I just noticed that I am not listed on the
  \href{https://liswiki.org/wiki/Weblogs}{LISWiki blogs list} in a
  currently active blog. Then again, I was still working for
  \texttt{\$EMPLOYER} at that time and blogging was against the regs if

  on my right hand is really messed up from exposure to so much cold.
  For having lived here as long as I have I should be better adapted to
  this.
