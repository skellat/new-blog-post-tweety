Well, sometimes online tests give strange results. Consider this chart:

\begin{figure}

\pandocbounded{\includegraphics[keepaspectratio]{\%7B\%7Bsite.url\%7D\%7D/img/politicalcompass.png}}
\caption{Output from the ``political compass'' site showing a result for
me of left-libertarian. In our shifting times what do left and right
even more?}
\end{figure}

I ended up taking the ``political compass'' test available at
\href{https://www.politicalcompass.org/}{politicalcompass.org}. I was
surprised at the output. Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised based upon the
shifts in the right lately.

I encourage people to try the test themselves.
