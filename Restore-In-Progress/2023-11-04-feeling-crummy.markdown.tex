As much as I might want to think that I have health issues conquered
they have this annoying habit of roaring back into my life. Being ill
for unknown reasons on a Friday night is not my definition of ``fun''. I
survived it, though.

There are some barriers that I would like to breach health-wise.
Unfortunately medical science is simply not there to support that
\emph{yet}. Life on the fringes of medical science can be weird at
points.
