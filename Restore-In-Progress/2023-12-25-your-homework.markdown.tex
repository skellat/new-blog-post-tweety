Here I am assigning homework on Christmas Day of all things. Consider
the integration of \href{http://www.nncpgo.org/Git.html}{NNCP with git}
as well as \href{https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle}{git bundles}
and the \href{https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitformat-bundle}{git bundle
format}. What sort of high level handler would \emph{you} want to help
escort your information back and forth in a possibly disconnected or
partially connected world? With the very possible return of Donald Trump
to power we'll be heading towards a somewhat authoritarian world. Moving
things around via
\href{https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet}{sneakernet} and
\href{https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email}{e-mail over non-Internet
routes} may be our best cases in the not so distant future.
