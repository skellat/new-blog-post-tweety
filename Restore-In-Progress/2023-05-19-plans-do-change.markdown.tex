Television is increasingly becoming Newton Minnow's vast wasteland. That
is to say, there's increasingly nothing on that's watchable. Much of
what's on isn't even riffable! When I start to sound like
\href{https://dumb-industries.com/shows/themadsareback}{The Mads} or
\href{https://www.rifftrax.com/about}{Mike, Kevin, and Bill} let alone
\href{https://www.gizmoplex.com/}{Emily and Jonah} while watching
regular broadcast you know something is wrong.

What's the plan as shows go on summer hiatus? Well, we'll be watching
more of
\href{https://dumb-industries.com/shows/themadsareback}{\emph{The Mads
Are Back}} at my home. We'll probably pick up the online version of
\href{https://drafthouse.com/series/master-pancake}{Master Pancake
Theater}. I'll probably visit \href{https://robot-zero.com}{my local
comic book store} more.

ABC is getting ready to launch a fall schedule made up almost entirely
of ``unscripted'' programming. The CW is getting set to launch a fall
schedule of sports, acquired foreign programming, \emph{All American},
and an abbreviated 13 episode season of \emph{Walker}. NBC cut back its
schedule but is basically going to be the Dick Wolf channel. CBS won't
be changing its line-up too much but isn't totally watchable on
broadcast. PBS is great when it is of interest but there is plenty I am
\emph{not} interested in at times.

These are strange times.
