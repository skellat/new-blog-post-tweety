Leaving Ashtabula seems like a great idea for my health. It seems like a
great idea for sanity. Where to go, though? That is the question. As
moats get deepened and drawbridges get pulled up in various places there
is increasingly a lack of viable places to go.

I am going to have to think about this more.
