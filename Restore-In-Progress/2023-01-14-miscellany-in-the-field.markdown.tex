While I am in Madison I should perhaps put forward another brief
miscellany in no particular order:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I am astounded that we are so quickly heading toward a possible
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sovereign_default&oldid=1120195953}{sovereign
  default} crisis here in the United States. We have stepped beyond
  brinksmanship and are shifting towards a ``Thelma and Louise'' moment.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We already have people
    \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20230114165122/https://www.starbeacon.com/opinion/chaos-no-it-was-free-speech-in-the-house/article_c6d05a4a-9373-11ed-a9fe-5fed3d4dfa83.html}{saying
    that the chaos at the start of this Congress in the House was a good
    thing} even though that's where this mad scheme was hatched
  \item
    The United States of America will hit its debt ceiling on
    \href{https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/13/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-debt-ceiling}{Thursday,
    January 19th}
  \item
    A commentator at Fox News is already
    \href{https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/house-republicans-right-no-debt-limit-increase-until-balanced-budget-plan-is-in-place}{calling
    for a form of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings on steroids}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was the first round of
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2013_United_States_budget_sequestration&oldid=1127719102}{sequestration}
    \item
      We had
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2013_United_States_budget_sequestration&oldid=1127719102}{sequestration}
      back in 2013 too
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Spending cuts are required under the recently adopted rules package
    for the House before any increase in the debt ceiling can even be
    considered. Yes,
    \href{https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/republicans-debt-ceiling-games-will-likely-backfire-rcna65339}{that
    means potentially cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid
    pretty hard}. If we can't cut those and we can't cut the military
    then we would end up shutting down entire cabinet departments and
    putting large parts of the government out of business.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The Constitution specifies the federal government having a
      military and a postal system in addition to the courts as well as
      agencies to regulate interstate commerce.\\
    \item
      Many agencies like the US Department of Education would simply
      have to be terminated.
    \item
      I wish I were making stuff up but these are the sorts of things
      the MAGA caucus \emph{wants} to do if folks like Lauren Boebert
      are to be believed
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Default
    \href{https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/13/politics/debt-limit-janet-yellen-letter-to-kevin-mccarthy/index.html}{could
    happen in June} if nothing is done
  \item
    In the proposed payment prioritization plan mentioned
    \href{https://news.yahoo.com/house-republicans-prepare-emergency-plan-000250667.html}{by
    Yahoo! News}, payments would be made for only certain critical areas
    while the rest would just go unpaid.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, and the military
      would be protected under such a plan
    \item
      No other bills would be paid by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service
      during such a plan
    \item
      Medicaid recipients would be left in a bad position
    \item
      Federal civilian staff would be left unpaid
    \item
      Air traffic controllers would be left unpaid
    \item
      What Could Possibly Go Wrong?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Fundraising efforts are being accelerated for the television project
\item
  Life gets amusing in the weirdest ways
\end{itemize}
