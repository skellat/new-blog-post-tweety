In a few hours I get to run through the last class session of the term.
I will be uploading the grades for my class shortly thereafter. There'll
be some institutional assessment paperwork that'll need to be done as
well so I'll want to wrap that up as quickly as possible to get it
turned in.

I'll blessedly get a week off before the next short term starts. I'll
get a few days off after the next short spring term before the summer
term where it'll be a heavier teaching load than I have had previously.
I don't know what the autumn plans are yet.

Travel opportunities are going to be limited for the time being.
