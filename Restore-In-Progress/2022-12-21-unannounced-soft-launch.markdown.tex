It seems that
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WSEE-TV&oldid=1126015926}{WSEE}
is changing up what it is airing on its \texttt{.3} subsidiary digital
channel. This normally should be \emph{Erie News Now Plus}. Instead
we're getting a basketball game from
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TheGrio&oldid=1127664863}{thegrio}.
They've not announced any affiliation changes. Of course, that may just
be how the game feed is branded. The question then is where the game
feed is coming from!

Yes, Ashtabula is \emph{technically} located in the Cleveland television
market. We only get \emph{Erie} television over-the-air. Physics is a
strange thing.
