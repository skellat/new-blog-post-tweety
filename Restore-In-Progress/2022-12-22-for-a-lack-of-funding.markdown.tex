I finally had someone outside Erie Looking Productions look at the draft
planning for standing up television production locally. No, it would not
be easy. No, it would not be cheap. Yes, it is needed. Oddly enough, the
assessment of need is not solely my own.

A lot of hits on \href{https://ko-fi.com/smkellat}{Ko-Fi} would help
provide seed cash. What would seed cash go to? At this point it would go
to setting up an appropriate LLC. A sole proprietorship isn't the best
fiscal mechanism for handling the finances of an endeavor like this.

Other funding avenues will need to be explored. As nice as crowdfunding
sounds it seems implausible in terms of success here in Ashtabula. There
is at least a
\href{https://www.indiegogo.com/explore/web-series-tv-shows?project_type=campaign&project_timing=all&sort=trending}{category
for things like this on Indiegogo} though
\href{https://www.kickstarter.com/publishing?ref=section-film-nav-click-publishing}{things
are a bit murky on Kickstarter}.

This is not nearly as easy as it looks in an area that is so highly
vulnerable socially as Ashtabula County.
