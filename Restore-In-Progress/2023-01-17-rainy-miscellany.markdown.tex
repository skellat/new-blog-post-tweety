M2 chip? - 9to5mac.com/2023/01/16/will-ap\ldots{} We've been hearing
rumors for the past few months that Apple has been working on multiple
new Macs. And according to new reports, at least some of these Macs --
including new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros -- may be announced as
soon as tomorrow. But there's one Mac that the rumors are not talking
about, and that's the iMac. Read on as we detail what we know about
Apple's plans for its all-in-one desktop.'' Posted on Jan 17, 2023 at

As to the M2 chip item, reports this morning came out that told us that
we would be seeing new fourteen and sixteen inch MacBook Pro laptops
hitting the market with such chips as well as Mac Mini units with M2
chips. The Intel and M1 Mac Mini units are off the deck now as to sales.
Since we lack capital to make purchases at the moment there won't be any
great rush to go out and get anything.
