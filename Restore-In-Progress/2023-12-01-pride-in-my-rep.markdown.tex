My local congressman, David Joyce, is a member of the House Ethics
Committee. He voted yes on expelling

Santos} from the House of Representatives. He was one of the few
Republicans to do so.

The dysfunction continues in the federal legislature, alas. I don't
think there is a plausible endpoint to this mess any time soon.
