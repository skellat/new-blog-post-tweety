Well, it appears that my current Mastodon host is going down. There will
be \emph{some} time before that happens, though. This means I have some
time to figure out where to bounce to.

The problem is determining \emph{where} to go.

There are many servers with many rules sets. Many of them are fairly
restrictive. I've been having trouble finding open general sites lately.

Do I need to stick around in the Mastodon end of the Fediverse? I don't
know.

There are many things I don't know lately.
