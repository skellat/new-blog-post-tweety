  \item [Wednesday, December 31, 2025] Initialize logging file.  210.6 lbs.  Lake effect snow continues.
  \item [Thursday, January 1, 2026] Slow day today.  211.6 lbs.  I'm thankful the political news is slow today.  I don't think I could've handled much more madness from our nation's capital.
  \item [Friday, January 2, 2026] Finally got news today that I was expecting.  That doesn't mean I actually like it.  I won't be getting promoted to full-time at work.  211.4 lbs.  Proper plans can proceed now, it seems.
  \item [Saturday, January 3, 2026] We invaded Venezuela for a snatch and grab.  This year is \emph{already} The Year of Spirals.  211.8 lbs.  The effort to get to 160 lbs continues.
  \item [Sunday, January 4, 2026] \ldots
