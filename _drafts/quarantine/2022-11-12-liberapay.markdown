In a post to the fediverse I saw that [Sean Davis](https://floss.social/@bluesabre/109331371874014635) had made mention of his Liberapay profile.  I suppose I should make mention of [my own Liberapay profile](https://liberapay.com/smkellat/) as well.  Right now support isn't critical as I am teaching but that comes to an end on December 14th.  I am only an adjunct instructor and not one word has been said yet about teaching next semester.  The schedule has fewer classes in computer & information systems than there are instructors so I *might* need support starting in January as I *might* have to retool things.

It would be funny if this turned into just a brief sojourn in teaching and then I moved on to doing something else in early 2023.  I have no clue right now what that might be.  A return to podcasting would be interesting although the field is kinda saturated these days.  It is still early days so I'll have to wait to see what develops.
