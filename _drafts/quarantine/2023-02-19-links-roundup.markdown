Let's look at some of the things that caught my eye in [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/).

Scripps News among others has reported ["US: Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine"](https://scrippsnews.com/stories/us-russia-has-committed-crimes-against-humanity-in-ukraine/).

I thought *The Nevers* was a great show when I watched it over at the aunt's house.  The back half of the show is now finally available **but** [you have to catch it on Tubi](https://www.polygon.com/23598491/the-nevers-season-1-free-online-unaired-episodes).

If you are a masochist you apparently [can install Windows 11 directly to a Raspberry Pi](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-tiny11-for-arm64-on-raspberry-pi-4).  That just seems so suboptimal even though [TechRadar talks about it too](https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-11-on-raspberry-pi-its-possible-thanks-to-tiny11).  If you're going to go that far off the beaten path then [consider trying RISC OS instead](https://www.riscosopen.org/wiki/documentation/show/GUI%20comparison:%20RISC%20OS%20vs%20Windows%20and%20macOS).  Their wiki [even has discussion of using it to build laptops featuring the BeagleBoard](https://www.riscos.info/index.php/BeagleBoard-based_Laptop), oddly enough.

TechRadar is [wishcasting as to seeing an Apple Silicon Mac Pro this year](https://www.techradar.com/news/mac-pro-2023-its-now-or-never-apple-your-customers-are-waiting).

The axe is still swinging at Warner Brothers Discovery as [Judge Mathis and People's Court have been canceled](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/judge-mathis-the-peoples-court-canceled-warner-bros-1235527589/).

Somebody did a write-up on [running a Nextcloud server using OpenBSD](https://x61.sh/log/2023/02/20230217T112354-nextcloud_openbsd.html).

Karen Kasler reports [that statehouse legislators are proposing to mess with the state's tax systems again](https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2023-02-17/schools-ohio-governments-could-lose-over-a-billion-dollars-from-tax-changes-backed-by-speaker).  Our state has many issues that *could* be addressed.  Tinkering with the tax systems is not one of the most pressing problems out there.

People still write about [tools for communicating in difficult circumstances as well as offline](https://www.complete.org/tools-for-communicating-offline-and-in-difficult-circumstances/).  Every day in Ashtabula County could be considered "difficult circumstances", I think.

In coming events we have the [6th Annual International PTEN Symposium](https://ptenfoundation.org/join-us-for-our-6th-annual-international-pten-symposium/) coming up in Cleveland in March.  I'll need to make some calendar space, it appears.

Another sad headline: [Female Bodybuilder Nashali Alma Fights Off Male Attacker in Alarming Viral Gym Video](https://fitnessvolt.com/nashali-alma-fights-off-male-attacker-gym/).  People are getting crazy.  My main reaction is to wonder why she didn't clock him with a dumbbell.

Bruce Schneier brings up the very real danger of [AI lobbyists](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/02/defending-against-ai-lobbyists.html).  Politics is gonna get weird.  ChatGPT could accelerate things like the QAnon cult, it seems.

So, there is a [BBS Builder available](https://hackaday.com/2023/02/16/bbs-builder-is-a-framework-for-running-your-own-petscii-paradise/) that people can use.  If you run [SyncTerm](http://www.syncterm.net) you'd be able to access the end product of using that tool.

Apple is starting an [in-house film school](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/02/17/apple-tv-needs-more-content-and-they-will-train-directors-to-get-it?utm_medium=rss)?

Open Technology Fund, a component of the United States Agency for Global Media, is [working on a summit to counter Internet shutdowns](https://www.opentech.fund/news/otf-debrief-introducing-the-shutdown-getdown/).  This could be a good thing.

COVID raises your risk of diabetes [by 58%](https://arstechnica.com/?p=1918140) even with the supposedly less concerning Omicron spreading around.

The great Les Pounder points out [the RetroFeed project for Raspberry Pi](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/raspberry-pi-retro-news-project) that might be something I could pursue some day.  It would make a great piece of set decoration if nothing else.

Microsoft [killed off Yammer finally](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-kills-off-the-enterprise-social-network-no-one-remembered-it-has).

Microsoft is [changing up its certifications a little bit](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-learn-blog/evolving-microsoft-365-certifications-help-keep-you-in-sync-with/ba-p/3719265).

Our intrepid legislators in Columbus are proposing a new way [to break the Internet for everybody](https://www.statenews.org/government-politics/2023-02-13/ohio-budget-includes-provision-to-require-social-media-companies-get-parental-permission-for-kids).

Somebody is proposing [an ultimate open source laptop](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/risc-v-laptop-easy-to-build-and-upgrade) running on RISC-V.

Apparently [DiscoBSD](https://github.com/chettrick/discobsd?utm_source=discoverbsd) is a thing.

Netflix has [taken *Arrested Development*](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/netflix-removing-arrested-development-original-seasons-1235521721/) down.  Good luck watching it now if you don't have it in a DVD box set.

LibreOffice is at version 7.5 and [competes against Microsoft 365 apparently now](https://www.techradar.com/news/libreoffice-still-thinks-it-can-steal-you-away-from-microsoft-365-or-google-workspace).

SlashFilm gets fairly direct by saying in their headline: ["In The Age Of Streaming, TV Preservation Matters More Than Ever"](https://www.slashfilm.com/1187497/in-the-age-of-streaming-tv-preservation-matters-more-than-ever/).

All of this was marked in my RSS reader.  Enjoy!
