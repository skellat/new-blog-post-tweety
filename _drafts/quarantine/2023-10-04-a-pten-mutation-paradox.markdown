I get to visit a Registered Dietitian tomorrow on referral from one of the many specialist physicians I have seen lately.  We get to argue tomorrow.  PTEN mutations lead to weird outcomes in people.  It leads to obesity but it *does not* generally lead to Type 2 Diabetes.  Yes, you read that right.  It can lead to obesity but still lead to very, very good blood sugar levels.

That means the medication weight loss plans like handing out metformin or one of the GLP-1 agonists kinda sorta have problems associated.  If you have a hemoglobin level at the lower edge of the normal you can't really go ahead with dropping blood sugar levels *further*.  That leads to even worse outcomes.

The [symposium down at CCF in March](https://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/live/courses/pten2023/) was when I heard Dr. Pier Paolo Pandolfi talking about the efficacy of ketogenic diets for managing weight in people with PTEN problems.  At the last visit the Registered Dietitian was more focused on Mediterranean Diet as an option for me to pursue so bringing up Keto would be something to talk about.  I looked at increasing personal physical activity levels but to do that most effectively I would need to give up work at the employer in Erie so that I could drop the commute that is 45-60 minutes driving one way.

Imagine: [putting on weight while having very low end blood sugar and it isn't necessarily insulin resistance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22970944/).  That's not a fun situation.  I know Dr. Pandolfi is working on stuff to deal with the matter but I think it is still very, very early phase work.

Complexity gets rough at points...
