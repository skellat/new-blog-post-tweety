A story posted recently brought some minor and not so minor concerns to mind.  CBS News [reported](https://web.archive.org/web/20230528070548/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senators-issued-satellite-phones-new-security-measures/) that federal senators were being issued sat phones.  The story went on to say that fifty out of the one hundred senators accepted them.  All that was said about the phones was that they're being deployed to ensure a redundant and secure means of communication during a disruptive event.

That sounds ominous.  Nowhere in the article is there any indication as to what sort of event is being planned against.  We're simply supposed to take it on faith that this is just a normal, regular, every day occurence in our federal government.

The comments on *Hacker News* as seen at <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36096342> do not shed much light on the situation.
