It looks like the SAG-AFTRA strike isn't ending any time soon.  I lamented that on the [most recent episode of 69 Admins](https://69admins.com/2023/episode-14.html) as I then put that show on its "hiatus for the holidays".  Frankly reruns are getting tiresome.  Family is getting tired of it too.

Within the scope of the contracts and avoiding being a scab, it would be possible to proceed with starting an actual play tabletop role playing game show.  We're at the point where this could be done with folks joining in via video call.  It could be a Linux community members group participating, for example.

I would want to start with [Parsely](http://www.memento-mori.com/pdf/parsely-pdf).  I went through one of the free adventures with one of my classes as an exercise during their "problem solving" module and that went quite well.  The folks at The Incomparable [have a range of podcast episodes illuminating some of these adventures](https://www.theincomparable.com/gameshow/actioncastle/) and how some tech people approach them.

The nice thing is that they're one shots and the level of investment required is low.  They're somewhat silly, too.
