In a somewhat peculiar order: 

* Getting 17 inches of snow on Thursday was not amusing.
  * Getting the snow plowed was a pain
  * We had snow emergencies declared by the sheriff for the first time in *decades* on Thursday
* "Torchy The Battery Boy" is premium nightmare fuel, it seems
* Twitter is imploding
  * Some reports indicate the company is down to ten percent of the headcount it had on the day before Elon Musk took control
  * The engineers required to keep systems running are now gone
  * Despite people claiming online rather earnestly that the banks that backed the deal will earnestly attempt to keep Twitter running there is the slight problem of staffing.  Software engineers are not interchangable widgets.  Twitter is a complicated, complex product with some homegrown components.  People with the relevant domain knowledge walked away.  Anybody who is brought in will have to be brought up to speed on something that will be ultimately foreign to them and might be impossible for them to master.
    * What could go wrong?
    * Since there are some "invented here" pieces of the Twitter tech stack the loss of so many engineers leads to the problem of finding replacements.  Could anybody step in to replace those who left?  If they can't find anybody the site's days are going to start running out.
