![Post by Stephen Michael Kellat. "Today is part of the 30th anniversary of the FBI's siege of the Branch Davidian cult compound in Waco, Texas.  The cult was led by David Koresh.  It was a dark moment in history. A political primary candidate for President of the United States has been acting like a cult leader.  He's been whipping up his followers.  He's already threatened that there would be "death and destruction" if he's indicted. He's holding a big campaign rally in Waco today.  He speaks at 1900Z.  This could be bad."
