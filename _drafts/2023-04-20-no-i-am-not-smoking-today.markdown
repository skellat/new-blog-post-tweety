"RT @RepSummerLee 16 y/o Ralph Yarl was shot in the head for knocking on the wrong door. 20 y/o Kaylin Gillis was shot & killed for pulling into the wrong driveway. 18 y/o Payton Washington was shot after accidentally trying to get in the wrong car. NOTHING about this is normal." Posted on Apr 20, 2023 at 10:45]({{site.url}}/img/rbreich-shootings.jpg)

No, none of this is really all that normal.  I understand that the United States of America is one of the more violent nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  This situation is more akin to some sort of deeper rot setting in.

Yeah, I am that sort of "old-fashioned" as well.
