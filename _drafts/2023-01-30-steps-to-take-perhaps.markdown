![Post by Chief TWiT. Content warning: "EmojiString(stringValue: Podcasting{
}, components: [EmojiString.EmojiString.Component.text(Podcasting{
})])". "Now that we're learning this lesson that centralized silos are brittle and operate in the interest of the owners not the users... ...please note the move toward centralizing podcasts into apps from Amazon/Audible, Spotify, iHeart, YouTube, TikTok etc. If you like podcasts, use an RSS-based podcast player. Support the open ecosystem. We can only survive if you clearly see the threat and act supportively."
