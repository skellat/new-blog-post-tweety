I am starting a week with some anxieties coming up.  I get to meet a new medical professional this week as part of my "care team".  University Hospitals of Cleveland operates a rather large network of locations through northeastern Ohio.  In this instance I have to meet with this person at their department's headquarters in Cleveland.
