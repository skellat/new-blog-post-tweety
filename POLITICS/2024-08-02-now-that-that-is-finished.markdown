In no particular order:

+ Another term at {redacted} is done.
  + I now have 11 offerings of the same class completed
  + I think I may now know what I'm doing with this by now
+ I end up missing the big visit by {redacted} at {redacted} next week
+ The visit to the specialist doctor on Wednesday was a bit confusing
+ I want to get some repairs done around the house
+ I have to figure out what I am swapping in for the previous VPS I was using on Oracle Cloud that I lost the ability to manage via the management console due to losing 2FA override codes
+ At certain points I am seeing people during the current Olympic games talking about health-related issues on Mastodon and left wondering.  I understand the concern about people feeling they fall outside the norms.  For those questioning things about health status just go get one of the consumer grade genetics tests to start.  I know 23andMe tests for things like Cowden Syndrome among other interesting things.  If you get a hit on it they tell you to see a doctor to properly confirm.  If you think you might be a wee bit abnormal health-wise perhaps you might start there?
+ The big MRI of {redacted} in seven days is going to be needlessly exciting as we'll be determining if something is steady state or if it has grown.  Hopefully it has not grown.
