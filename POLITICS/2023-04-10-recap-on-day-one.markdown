I praise the Lord for giving us things like [Big Finish Productions](https://bigfinish.com/) in our world.  Listening to dramas from [The Worlds of Gerry Anderson](https://www.bigfinish.com/collections/v/the-worlds-of-gerry-anderson) as well as [Doctor Who](https://www.bigfinish.com/hubs/v/doctor-who) makes the drive from home to the employer that much more tolerable.  It is definitely a shorter distance to get to this site compared to the other two but I'm still traveling about 40 miles *one-way*.

Duty went far better than I expected it would this morning.  {REDACTED}

One of my absolute favorite romps from Big Finish is their [Space: 1999](https://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/v/space-1999) revival.  I highly recommend it.  It does *not* mimic the storylines entirely of the original television series.  It was part of a great round of stories to listen to during the fall round of commuting.

As odd as it may seem for this blog there actually can be good news at times.
