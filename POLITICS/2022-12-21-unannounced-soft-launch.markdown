![A VLC screenshot of over-the-air television reception of the WSEE subsidiary channel 35.3.  Previously this would have been a rolling automated weather graphic.  Instead this is a basketball game courtesy thegrio.]({{site.url}}/img/35-3-monitoring.jpg)

It seems that [WSEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=WSEE-TV&oldid=1126015926) is changing up what it is airing on its `.3` subsidiary digital channel.  This normally should be *Erie News Now Plus*.  Instead we're getting a basketball game from [thegrio](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=TheGrio&oldid=1127664863).  They've not announced any affiliation changes.  Of course, that may just be how the game feed is branded.  The question then is where the game feed is coming from!

Yes, Ashtabula is *technically* located in the Cleveland television market.  We only get *Erie* television over-the-air.  Physics is a strange thing.
