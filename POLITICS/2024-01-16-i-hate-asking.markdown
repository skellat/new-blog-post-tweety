I'm going to need help.  Our daily newspaper is falling to pieces.  Nothing is there to replace it.  As much as I want to try to do something, I can't.  A simple e-mail newsletter won't cut the mustard.  There needs to be a reporting staff and more.  There needs to be people to handle money.  There needs to be production people.

I can identify the problem.  I'm not the best one to try to fix it.  I most certainly can't fix it *alone*.  Asking for help to do so is extremely hard.  There are many, many good reasons to just let things fail here in Ashtabula since the community seems hell-bent on a "managed decline" approach to life.

This is not a good mess to be in.
