After switching the hosting on this site away from Netlify to GitHub Pages it is probably time for another miscellany of relatively brief items.  In no particular order:  

+ I no longer have anything hosted via Netlify now.  
  + This blog was shifted off Netlify to GitHub Pages.  
  + The site for Erie Looking Productions was shifted to a Raspberry Pi Zero W 2 that is sitting in my basement that is exposed to the world using PageKite and a CNAME set up on the DNS for the domain name  
  + At one point this blog was going to live on the RPi Zero W 2 in addition to the Erie Looking Productions site but redoing the logistics of Jekyll was getting too fiddly.
+ I have procured a Lenovo T480 to use on work taskings and it is now running Windows 11.  
+ I have been having strange dreams.  I blame [*Bikini Hackers*](https://tubitv.com/movies/712905/bikini-hackers?start=false).
+ There is another round of appointments coming up with medical practitioners that I haven't met before.
  + I'll be meeting a dietitian for the first time on Thursday.
  + I'll be meeting a particular neurologist for the first time on the following Monday.
  + The care odyssey continues and the answers that we're finding are frankly resulting in even more questions.
  + Rare conditions are not fun things.  Second opinions aren't things you can simply seek.  First opinions by themselves probably could lead to articles in medical journals!
+ Efforts continue relative to finding somewhere else to live.  We've lost our last local movie theater.  When the local Walmart closes down it would be quite fair to say my area would be on an accelerated course towards being a ghost town.
+ *Colossus: The Forbin Project* is a very weird movie.  I see now why it is a touchstone that comes up in riffing by Frank Conniff.
+ Class is going to look different in the fall semester as we're ditching the textbook from Pearson and will be going with something different.  My current group really, really do not like the Pearson text.
+ Some things need to get off the drawing board as the world around me deteriorates.
