Yeah, I hate to ask.  Having the financial support to conduct some operations in Ashtabula would be nice.  Being able to do things such as create content *properly* would be nice.  Being able to write fiction would be nice.  Being able to pay off the new furnace I had to put on revolving credit would be nice even.

The drive to and from Erie is wearing me out at points.  After December 6th I am done on this work tasking for calendar year 2023.  Anything to drive the resolution of financial concerns would be great as 2024 is looking like a bit of a mess.

Support and patronage can be provided via [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/smkellat) and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/smkellat) at this time.  I've been working on trying to set up Patreon but that's more complicated than I want it to be.  Oh, the financial bits were the easy part.  Arranging an order of what would be provided to patrons on a regular basis is the difficult part.

I have a few hundred words written on a new fiction story.  It is an idea that has been bopping around in my head.  I have no clue where this story might go yet.  The escapades of the "Reality Control Division" of the police do sound a bit trippy, though.  No, I'm not referring to that very special hit ["Idiot Control Now"](https://mst3k.fandom.com/wiki/Idiot_Control).
