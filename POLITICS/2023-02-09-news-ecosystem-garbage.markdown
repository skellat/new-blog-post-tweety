![Post by Nieman Journalism Lab. ""A cascade of changes started to appear in the AI-generated testosterone article, correcting various errors [...] until the piece was almost unrecognizable." futurism.com/neoscope/magazineâ€¦" Posted on Feb 9, 2023 at 15:31 https://mastodon.social/@niemanlab/109836678699676049]({{site.url}}/img/bad-ai-1.jpg)

The linked article from Futurism at <https://web.archive.org/web/20230209210750/https://futurism.com/neoscope/magazine-mens-journal-errors-ai-health-article> is quite the horrifying read.  When broken down to its essentials, the owner of the *Mens Journal* publication tried to substitute AI for having any writing staff.  The results were a very bad mess of incorrect medical advice.

Other than them getting caught in the end I could see other publications trying to do this.  Humans are expensive and our economy is in a weird state.  We saw *Axios* talking about a crisis facing news publications in our country [in 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20230129153829/https://www.axios.com/2022/07/04/local-newspapers-news-deserts).  Similar discussion was found in *The Guardian* [in 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20220625121318/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-us-newspapers-impact).  Whether we like it or not we're going to see more garbage in the news ecosystem produced by AI.

Is there a positive way to look at this turn of events?  Well, now is probably a fabulous time to start looking at building out using [owncast](https://owncast.online) and other tools like possibly [Newscoop](https://www.sourcefabric.org/software/newscoop).  The [Center for Community Media](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/centers/center-community-media/) led by Jeff Jarvis is probably going to be needed to help blaze trails in rebuilding this part of the knowledge ecology.
