Unfortunately I had to go back and scrub references to something from the blog.  New procedures have been adopted as to social media usage at the employer.  There was an incident and it was bad.  From what little I have been told about the incident frankly I'm embarrassed by what happened.

Well, this happens.  As long as I remain in active status with the employer I have to go this route.  If I drop to inactive status for an extended period I can reassess things but that's not expected for some time, if at all.  Apparently ***REDACTED***
