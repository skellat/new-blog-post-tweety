Headline from POLITICO: "[Trump on immigrants: ‘We got a lot of bad genes in our country right now’](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/07/trump-immigrants-crime-00182702)"

Even for non-immigrants in the United States [dealing with all sorts of genetic disorders](https://www.cdc.gov/genomics-and-health/about/genetic-disorders.html), this is downright terrifying that he's talking like this.  We saw the pogrom here in Ohio against Haitian immigrants down in Springfield.  If that monster starts a pogrom against people with genetic disorders thanks to his foolish remarks about "bad genes" then quite a cross-section of America would be in danger.

HOW MUCH MORE ARYAN DOES THIS ORANGE MONSTER NEED TO GET BEFORE PEOPLE TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY?

It isn't like people with rare genetic disorders [have the easiest of times managing things](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1488/#_phts_Management_) as it is.

The big fear is that he gets elected because my fellow countrymen basically went insane.  If that happens frankly my position becomes quite unsafe.  I'm going to have to look harder at boltholes, I think.
