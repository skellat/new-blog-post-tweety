Since we're past the one year point in this blog it is interesting to look back at what was being talked about one year ago.  On this day last year I wrote:

>*Well, that's frankly rather disturbing.  Mr. Musk really wants to appeal to a core audience of craziness.  Keeping the Trump dream alive definitely resonates with part of the economy, perhaps.  It is part of the economy I truly do not want to take part in.  The former president has done so many wild things that the Justice Department brought in a former war crimes prosecutor who handled cases *from Kosovo* to handle the January 6th and classified documents investigations.  Wouldn't a reasonable person think that perhaps that's a clue that we may be dealing with a supervillain here?*

One year later we've found that Mr. Trump is sticking with Truth Social and isn't really touching his restored X/Twitter account.  He's becoming increasingly kooky in what he is posting.  X/Twitter is increasingly becoming a cesspool and advertisers are bailing out again after Elon Musk supported some vile anti-semitic content.

Things haven't gotten better as time has gone by.
