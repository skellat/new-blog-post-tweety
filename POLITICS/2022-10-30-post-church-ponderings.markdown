Okay, I am a wee bit worried now.  The new CEO to Twitter is essentially running the site down by posting his own garbage.  Who can challenge it?  Frankly nobody.  The only way to challenge is to simply walk away at this point.  I’m already in step with [“Popehat” in terms of taking action](https://twitter.com/popehat/status/1586444996189728768).

Things are just very messy at the moment.  We have crazy people attacking politicians and their families in violation of [the assassination statue 18 USC 351](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/351).  Republicans of the majority faction of the party are all in a snit trying to secure the levers of power at the moment.  The minority faction is finding itself adrift without a real political home.

There is [already a joint intelligence bulleting warning of domestic extremism](https://www.opb.org/article/2022/10/29/ahead-of-election-day-us-agencies-warn-of-potential-attacks-by-extremists/) while [Steve Bannon is apparently calling for violence](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/steve-bannon-calls-maga-community-to-arms-says-theyre-the-cavalry/ar-AA13w2Wj).  POLITICO is [drawing parallels to the 1850s](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/10/29/political-violence-1850s-paul-pelosi-00064107) as to our currently unsettled environment.

If I could accurately predict where things will go then I wouldn't need to have a day job.  I normally have runs of bad luck when visiting casinos.  Preparedness is going to be the key to our near-term weirdness in America, it seems.

In other news:

* We got the livestream feed fixed so that it will show in the nursery in the building.  That way anybody who has to head back there can keep up with service and not miss out.
* Plans are continuing to be developed for [the big project](https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp).
* Eventually I will be doing some radio "data modes" stuff on shortwave before the end of 2022.  It seems prudent.  
* The project for [building low-budget community penny press newspapers using LaTeX](https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/auto-newspaper) will hopefully get more attention from me soon.
