In no particular order:

+ I eventually need to get my sermon written for preaching on December 31st at Geneva Church of Christ.
+ I've received an exciting offer that I have confusing feelings about.  I still said yes to it, though.
+ I didn't realize the Census Bureau now has county profiles [such as one for Ashtabula County](https://data.census.gov/profile/Ashtabula_County,_Ohio?g=050XX00US39007).
+ The stats from Census about [adults with disabilities in our county](https://data.census.gov/vizwidget?g=050XX00US39007&infoSection=Disability) are disturbing.  The overall picture of the county's health situation seen in the [PLACES visualization from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/places/about/index.html) doesn't look great either.
+ The worship planning meeting on Saturday morning has things mostly arranged to get us through the end of the year operationally.
  + We won't be doing a Christmas Eve service this year
  + We won't be doing a Christmas Day service this year
  + Easter is going to be at the end of March 2024 and that'll be the next major service we end up planning
+ Petey is getting more stubborn on walks.
  + Petey is a stubborn chihuahua
  + The dog is my main walking partner
  + I think he's expecting snow that hasn't shown up *yet*  
  + Walking on the old treadmill is *boring*
+ The marriage question keeps popping up
  + No, I don't have a good answer as to why I am not married
  + The constant promotion of the "Marriage Pact" reality show is probably what prompted the asking of the questions
  + I've kinda given up looking for the time being as I *still* have interesting scary things to learn when I visit the doctor's office each time I visit
+ I know not what 2024 brings
  + Anything can happen, really
  + I suspect there will be outbreaks of violence somewhere that will be election-related
  + We will quite probably all be learning the mechanics of the 12th Amendment next year as to what a "contingency election" looks like which hasn't happened in this country since 1824
  + There will be separatists trying hard to crack the country up
  + "AI" is likely to go in weird directions
+ Christmas may be weird if I don't finish a few things up
