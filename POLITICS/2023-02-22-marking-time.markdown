I don't know what is worse.  I am waiting on my two tax returns to be processed.  According to the Ohio Department of Taxation the state return is done.  I'm just waiting for the Internal Revenue Service to finish processing my federal return.  Once all that processing is done I can then figure out the most difficult component of all which happens to be municipal income taxation.

The other thing I am waiting on is medical test results.  My follow-up appointment with the medical provider is next week on a Friday.  The possibilities are fifty-fifty.  Hopefully the test comes back negative and I can simply move on.  If the test comes back positive my life would turn into a metaphorical car crash for a time.  I can't predict how this one will turn out.

I'm not sure I even want to know the result of the test.  I decided it was best to move ahead with it to remove doubts.  The waiting is just getting to me.
