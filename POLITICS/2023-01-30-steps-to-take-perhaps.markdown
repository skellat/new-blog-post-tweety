Support the open ecosystem. We can only survive if you clearly see the threat and act supportively."

I've been evaluating what options are available in the F/LOSS realm as counterparts to Microsoft Teams.  Teams is the toolbox that would allow for effectively a virtual studio.  As much as I would like to use Nextcloud to do the same thing the problem is that it would only be part of a *modular* solution.  I would need to bolt on Collabora Online to have shared office applications.  I would need to also bolt on Nextcloud Talk to have video conferencing that is otherwise built in to Teams.  BigBlueButton would be another option for video conferencing, I suppose.  

At this point we're looking at no real way to surmount operational difficulties.  The  local [Century 21 commercial listings](https://commercial.century21.com/real-estate/ashtabula-county-oh/LNOHASHTABULA/?kw=&pt=) are not all that plentiful in terms of finding space.  It isn't as if [the old Outdoor Army Navy Store](https://www.remaxcommercial.com/ListingDetails/4420-Main-Avenue-Ashtabula-OH-44004/1023527830) is the *best* option let alone affordable.  There's no real estate option that is workable at this point.

If I start working up a budget I could proceed with crowdfunding.  Ruling out real estate options and having a cloud convergence play might keep costs reasonable.  The majority of the costs would still boil down to personnel.  That would be unavoidable in any instance.  The best I could say is that a "shoestring budget" for this would still be high five figures/low six figures.

If we reduced things to audio-only we could stay in the five figure range.  The problem there is consumer uptake.  There simply would not be high uptake compared to visual content.  The amount of "visual learners" we have locally breaks against a successful audio podcast operation.

More thought is required, it seems.
