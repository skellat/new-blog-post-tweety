In no particular order:

+ All my grades and paperwork are turned in
  + I'm done with teaching for 2023
  + I have some administrative hurdles to clear as to 2024
+ We have a budding dictator
  + Yes, we have to honor the threats being uttered by The Old Man
  + There is no way to be dictator for "one day only"
    + Shredding the constitution is shredding the constitution
    + Having absolute power like that is something that cannot be done *temporarily*
  + We've got Steve Bannon calling for a [purge of people who aren't Christian Nationlist types](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/steve-bannon-non-christian-nationalists-all-have-to-be-purged-in-trumps-second-term/ar-AA1kZkoL)
    + It is being treated [as if it were a matter of spiritual renewal](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/steve-bannon-calls-for-his-enemies-to-be-purged/ar-AA1l5MAx)!
    + This disturbs me greatly
  + The man already was involved in one attempt at a coup d'Ã©tat so I think frankly he needs to be taken at face value rather than discounting these statements as merely attempts to gin up his political base
+ Weight loss efforts continue but are slow
+ I eventually need to get a new passport set
+ Christmas is apparently going to be celebrated at home in Ashtabula
+ We're looking at staffing loss at *The Star Beacon* and I'm getting concerned that they're below acceptable minimums to be able to continue to produce a newspaper
  + We need a study as to the news seeking behaviors of the local populace
  + The ridiculous part already observed in that regard was when I did the "Smart Streaming Television" presentation at Harbor-Topky Memorial Library
    + People were calling after the event complaining they knew nothing about it
    + It ran in *The Star Beacon* and *The Gazette* for over **one month**
    + It was highlighted on the library's Facebook account
    + There was promotional material inside the library and handouts
    + What were people expecting?  Canvassers?
+ The dating and relationships scene continues to be effectively dead
  + Ashtabula County is effectively equivalent to the outback
  + The selection pool is just not that big here
+ The push to relocate continues
  + I have to buckle down and write up pitches to those two medical schools
    + Art schools retain life models for their students to draw
    + Would such medical schools be willing to retain a relatively high functioning patient with A Rare Condition for students to poke, prod, and observe?
    + Family preferences are relocating to Toronto or Brisbane for...well...political reasons facing the USA at the moment
  + In terms of "continuity of care" the possible places I can go are very limited
  + The places where people are available that specialize in The Rare Condition are simply not that numerous
    + Cleveland, Ohio
    + Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
    + Boston, Massachusetts
    + Melbourne, Victoria, Australia
    + Southampton, England, United Kingdom
  + Unfortunately I am not blessed with being able to just ignore The Rare Condition
  + The next round of diagnostic surveillance tests picks up in April
+ I don't like watching my country decide that democracy was a bad idea and shift towards authoritarian autocracy
+ This year is ending on an odd note, I guess
