It is more than likely this will seem like a stream of consciousness.  In no particular order:

* The letter to the editor in *The Gazette* ran Wednesday about straming video services in Ashtabula County.  The idea is out there now.  We just need to take it to execution.
* The weather is frightful.  Most of my fitness activities involve being *outside*.  It is a little too treacherous to be outside right now even with boots, gloves, and coat.  I don't like this.
* There are now more than 230 feeds in the [tracking repository](https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/FeedReadingFeeds) if people want to find a new RSS feed to follow.
* The podcast feeds list [is updated and has odd items in it](https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/Podcasting), I suppose.
* Part of the grand plan for 2023 was that various vendor certifications would be pursued such as those from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/) and [Apple](https://training.apple.com/it).  That fell to the wayside due to unexpected contingencies arising.  I may yet get back to it.
* Change is needed in how my life is going.  How that may happen is unknown.
