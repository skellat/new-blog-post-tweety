On Saturday there was [a new episode of *69 Admins*](https://69admins.com/2023/episode-7.html) where we continued to talk about rural perspectives on accessing streaming television.  Yeah, accessing such things is different in places like Ashtabula County compared to bigger places like Cleveland.  I spent a bit of time at the beginning of the episode talking about material disappearing from online services.  There's an essay on *The Conversation* [that takes a look at that issue too](https://theconversation.com/streaming-services-are-removing-original-tv-and-films-what-this-means-for-your-favourite-show-and-our-cultural-heritage-208746).  

I highly recommend reading that essay.
