Apparently the infamous surveillance balloon got really warm earlier today.  Quoting @w7voa@journa.host: <https://journa.host/@w7voa/109808549003101808> #retoot

Why did NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, let this balloon wander into the United States Air Defense Identification Zone ("ADIZ") and through the continental area?  There are plenty of questions that need asking.  The ADIZ is [plenty big](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Air_Defense_Identification_Zone_(North_America)&oldid=1130570264).  I don't think this is necessarily the last we'll hear about this situation.

Apparently this is not the first time we've had one of these balloon transits either.  The folks at the Pentagon are being a bit *too* open in a statement.  Quoting @w7voa@journa.host: <https://journa.host/@w7voa/109810436558981248> #retoot
