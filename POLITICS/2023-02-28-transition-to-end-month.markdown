In light of changing circumstances I have shifted off <https://mas.to> to <https://ubuntu.social>.  I just shut down the script on the free tier instance on Oracle Cloud that posts links to new blog entries.  Whatever I did with [feed2toot](https://gitlab.com/chaica/feed2toot) to get credentials done right is apparently not easily done at this hour of night in shifting servers.  I'll try again when it is light outside.

Yeah, this is a shift.  It had been time to shift for a while.
