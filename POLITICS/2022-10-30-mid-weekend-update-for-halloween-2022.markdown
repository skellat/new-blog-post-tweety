Right now I'm enjoying the [Archers Omnibus podcast](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnkc).  Hearing how rural life can be somewhat sane is a good thing.  Life here in Ashtabula County is still unsettled.

I had [yet another letter to the editor](https://web.archive.org/web/20221029073248/https://www.starbeacon.com/opinion/new-gop-is-on-the-wrong-path/article_e3b35ed8-56eb-11ed-82ad-97837fe5926a.html) printed in *The Star Beacon*.  I'm pretty sure the local party membership is not enthused by what I had to say.  That we're even in a position for me to be able to say things like I did is problematic.

I don't know where things are going in life.  As things continue to deteriorate in public life I am feeling push to find a bolthole.  Run to Canada?  Run to Australia?  With racism and anti-semitism on the rise it does seem like malign forces are seeking to dominate and control.
