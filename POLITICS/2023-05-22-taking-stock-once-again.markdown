We're getting down to the wire on the debt ceiling, it seems.  The zealots in the House of Representatives are not going to make this simple.  If they stick to the formalism of having bills posted for 72 hours prior to a vote and if the Senate demands time to read the bill first then we *practically* have to have a deal done before Friday to be able to avoid the looming hard deadline of June 1st.  It seems quite uncertain that they're going to manage to get this done.
