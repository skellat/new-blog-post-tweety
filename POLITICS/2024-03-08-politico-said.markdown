Politico mentioned about last night's State of the Union address that Donald Trump was making a post storm over on Truth Social.  A problem arose in terms of connectivity somewhere along the line.  That resulted in totally decontextualized posts standing alone at points.

The folks at *The Dispatch* published an editorial headlined [The American People Should Demand Better](https://thedispatch.com/article/the-american-people-deserve-better/).  For the most part I agree with the editorial.  I go beyond it as saying that we need a third choice.  Two angry ancient men are hardly wise choices to lead the republic.  We need a viable third choice that isn't a lunatic anti-vaxx person that helped cause a measles epidemic in Western Samoa, for example.

This is going to be a year of excitement in ways none of us truly want, it seems.
