While I am in Madison I should perhaps put forward another brief miscellany in no particular order:

* I am astounded that we are so quickly heading toward a possible [sovereign default](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sovereign_default&oldid=1120195953) crisis here in the United States.  We have stepped beyond brinksmanship and are shifting towards a "Thelma and Louise" moment.
  * We already have people [saying that the chaos at the start of this Congress in the House was a good thing](https://web.archive.org/web/20230114165122/https://www.starbeacon.com/opinion/chaos-no-it-was-free-speech-in-the-house/article_c6d05a4a-9373-11ed-a9fe-5fed3d4dfa83.html) even though that's where this mad scheme was hatched
  * The United States of America will hit its debt ceiling on [Thursday, January 19th](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/13/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-debt-ceiling)
  * A commentator at Fox News is already [calling for a form of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings on steroids](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/house-republicans-right-no-debt-limit-increase-until-balanced-budget-plan-is-in-place)
    * Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was the first round of [sequestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2013_United_States_budget_sequestration&oldid=1127719102)
    * We had [sequestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2013_United_States_budget_sequestration&oldid=1127719102) back in 2013 too
  * Spending cuts are required under the recently adopted rules package for the House before any increase in the debt ceiling can even be considered.  Yes, [that means potentially cutting Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid pretty hard](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/republicans-debt-ceiling-games-will-likely-backfire-rcna65339).  If we can't cut those and we can't cut the military then we would end up shutting down entire cabinet departments and putting large parts of the government out of business.
    * The Constitution specifies the federal government having a military and a postal system in addition to the courts as well as agencies to regulate interstate commerce.  
    * Many agencies like the US Department of Education would simply have to be terminated.
    * I wish I were making stuff up but these are the sorts of things the MAGA caucus *wants* to do if folks like Lauren Boebert are to be believed
  * Default [could happen in June](https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/13/politics/debt-limit-janet-yellen-letter-to-kevin-mccarthy/index.html) if nothing is done
  * In the proposed payment prioritization plan mentioned [by Yahoo! News](https://news.yahoo.com/house-republicans-prepare-emergency-plan-000250667.html), payments would be made for only certain critical areas while the rest would just go unpaid.
    * Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, and the military would be protected under such a plan
    * No other bills would be paid by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service during such a plan
    * Medicaid recipients would be left in a bad position
    * Federal civilian staff would be left unpaid
    * Air traffic controllers would be left unpaid
    * What Could Possibly Go Wrong?
* Fundraising efforts are being accelerated for the television project
* Life gets amusing in the weirdest ways
