X/Twitter is becoming an inhospitable cesspool.  Will it be abated as a nuisance?  Only time will tell.

In an [article posted by Axios](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/16/economist-trump-2024-presidential?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=editorial) we have a horrible discussion of the relative danger to the world posted by Donald John Trump.  We're sleepwalking toward disaster it seems.  We'll have to wait and see what erupts, I think.

Good!  Unfortunately we've had a copycat law introduced in our state legislature in Ohio.  This might scare our goofballs in Columbus from trying to do such a thing here.

In [this article](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/16/newspapers-decline-hedge-funds-research) we see a not so happy picture painted.  I do quibble with their [mapping](https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/explore/#/newsNaper?state=OH&stateCode=39) as to Ashtabula County.  Four of the five outlets they refer to are just variant titles of the same weekly newspaper.  Content differs between the four by maybe five percent or so seemingly.  In the early days of the pandemic there was no differentiation of content whatsoever between the four variant titles.  In practical functional terms we have **one** daily newspaper and **one** weekly newspaper.  The **one** daily newspaper is a CNHI property that is a [ghost newspaper](https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss-of-local-news/the-rise-of-the-ghost-newspaper/).  As to the weekly newspaper, it covers many things but having a weekly cover a territory equal in size to *Rhode Island* means you're missing things even if you're trying really, really hard.

I just found [this particular article](https://www.pcmag.com/articles/content-is-king-which-streaming-services-have-the-best-selection) hilarious due to how highly [Tubi](https://tubitv.com/) was ranked.  Tubi is home to great films like [*The Humanoids*](https://tubitv.com/movies/502449/the-creation-of-the-humanoids?start=false) and [*War Between The Planets*](https://tubitv.com/movies/502446/war-between-the-planets) among many other strange ones.  They have a good independent film selection, too.

The indefatigable Tyler Buchnan made a [quick look at weird results](https://www.axios.com/local/columbus/2023/11/16/ohio-weird-election-results-2023?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=editorial) around the Buckeye State.

And, of course, the AI front continues to be odd.  The prompt was:

>*A very friendly, very frisky, rather feminine, aerobic fitness enthusiast from Wildemount who has a day job as a cleric for The Traveler is having an assignation with a quite frisky female bodybuilder who is a cleric of The Changebringer teaching at the Academy of Magic.*

This was clearly a prompt rooted in the fantasy realm where I was trying to break the parser again and get an absurd outcome.  This is what was gotten:

![Prompt used: "A very friendly, very frisky, rather feminine, aerobic fitness enthusiast from Wildemount who has a day job as a cleric for The Traveler is having an assignation with a quite frisky female bodybuilder who is a cleric of The Changebringer teaching at the Academy of Magic."]({{site.url}}/img/ai-output-fantasy.jpg)

DALL-E 3 has problems interpreting inputs at times, though.  As Harry McCracken has been finding, these image generation AI models have interesting problems.

Things are getting weird as we wind down 2023...
