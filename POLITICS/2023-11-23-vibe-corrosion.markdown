The television station WJW in Cleveland ran this story: [10+ Ohio towns that give ‘Hallmark Christmas Movie’ vibes](https://fox8.com/news/10-ohio-towns-that-give-hallmark-christmas-movie-vibes/)

No, no town in Ashtabula County is on that list.  Many of the towns here give ["Roger Corman movie"](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roger_Corman_filmography&oldid=1183488896) vibes instead.  Once upon a time we might have had that "Hallmark Christmas" thing happening in spots locally but with the advent of the MAGA corrosion it is pretty much gone.
