I've yelled at my local congressman to remind him that he too is a border congressman.  He just happens to represent the *northern* border that touches Canada's border line out in the middle of Lake Erie.  Ashtabula County literally borders Elgin and Norfolk counties of Canada's Ontario province.

Texas was doing some crazy and inhuman things out there.  Texas militia on state mission orders was clashing with federal forces.  Texas was raising some crazy arguments under [Clause 3 of Section 10 of Article I of the federal constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-10/clause-3/) which states:

>*No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.*

The main argument Texas has been making is that it thinks it is "actually invaded" and that it can therefore proceed with war-like acts without the federal government's consent as it tries to beat back the supposed invader.  They lost on that argument in the original trial.  When they went on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit they got an injunction that effectively breathed life back into their argument.  The Chief Justice and justices Barrett, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson nuked the injunction.

The Republican Party is exceedingly fixated on the southern border.  The governors of Texas and Florida have been using it to cause an interstate crisis by shipping migrants around the country.  This legal battles creates a further flashpoint.

I've referred to the events of the 2021 coup attempt by the cultists as being akin to [John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry](https://www.nps.gov/articles/john-browns-raid.htm).  It wasn't the main event.  It was only a prelude.  Are we looking at something in Texas where things may kick off?  When you have uniformed state militia preventing federal employees and federal law enforcement from doing their jobs as we've already seen at Eagle Park, you're not that far away from something stupid happening.

The next big event is the primary Tuesday in New Hampshire.  Nikki Haley has to win it or the Republican primary is basically over.  If the vote turns out in keeping with opinion polls, we're possibly going to see her drop out in short order.

Remember what I wrote a few days ago about lived horror?  Generally it starts slowly.  The pace picks up fairly quickly.

The deepfake calls copying President Biden's voice urging voters in New Hampshire to not vote on Tuesday are only the beginning of AI-fueled chaos this year, I think...
