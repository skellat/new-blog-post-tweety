In no particular order:

+ Yes, I am still shaken by the political violence that took place in Butler on Saturday
  + We're tumbling down a very dark path with this going on
  + Of course, the lack of political violence during much of my life might actually be *the anomaly* rather than the norm
+ The work over the state line continues
  + I am proud of what I am doing
  + Sadly I cannot openly acknowledge the work
+ Sleep is a rather difficult matter lately
+ Some scheduling complications are coming up
+ I wish I could be more specific than this...
