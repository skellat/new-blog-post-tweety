I am finding that [podget](https://github.com/dvehrs/podget) makes a very good tool for a central downloading system for podccasts.  Why have a single system downloading podcasts in the home?  Well, we've been having turbulence with our broadband yet again.  It is better to download once and then copy to mobile devices to be played using [one version](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-appletv.html) of VLC or [another](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-ios.html).  

Of course, an "Always Free" virtual machine in one cloud or another is running the same thing as a backup.  No, it isn't pretty.  I also do a lot of commuting lately.  If we hit a contingency of not having home broadband service for an extended period I would theoretically still be able to reach the VM from somewhere else on the road.  

Now, if I get [NNCP Go](http://www.nncpgo.org/) hooked up to this then some really interesting things become possible...
