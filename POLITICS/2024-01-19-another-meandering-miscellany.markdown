In no particular order:

+ I have my syllabus polished up and submitted so that I can head back to teaching in **two weeks**
+ Wintry weather is great *except* when it comes all at once
+ I guess I'm being pulled in too many directions to participate in the [Public Domain Game Jam 2024](https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/01/and-were-off-time-to-get-started-on-this-years-public-domain-game-jam/)
  + The idea would've involved doing something with *early* Hardy Boys
  + A hack of [*Lasers and Feelings*](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings) would've been easiest to get off the ground in time available
  + Yes, I realize a one-page RPG related to the Hardy Boys might be weird yet consider the times we find ourselves in
  + The guys from the Linux Matters podcast have made games before so I think even they could manage a one-page RPG of some sort
+ The local newspaper is shrinking further
  + The two remaining writers are taking turns as to days for writing the majority of the paper's content
  + This is not sustainable
  + The stories that are reaching print are fairly short
  + It is more likely than not that the two writers are missing things since they can't be in two places at once
+ Getting outside the house would be nice if it weren't so stinking cold...
