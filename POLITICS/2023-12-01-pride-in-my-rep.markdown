My local congressman, David Joyce, is a member of the House Ethics Committee.  He voted yes on expelling [George Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_Santos&oldid=1187817498) from the House of Representatives.  He was one of the few Republicans to do so.

The dysfunction continues in the federal legislature, alas.  I don't think there is a plausible endpoint to this mess any time soon.
