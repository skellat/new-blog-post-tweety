Well, the United States Supreme Court dropped several opinions today.  This was the tail-end of a controversial group of opinions.  Most of these outcomes have been pretty bad.  

As much as I might say something about the opinions I think I won't.  The simplest thing to say is that it is getting weird.  I do think some lines were crossed that we may not be able to easily handle.  

If I were a regular person then this wouldn't be a big deal.  Unfortunately there are some unique problems that I face that put me in some vulnerable spots with the way circumstances are coming together.  Right now I have access to the medical care that I need.  That sort of care would easily become imperiled if the angry man from Florida won control of the federal government.  Why?  Well, one of the quarterbacks in the federal government that [helps advance research](https://ncats.nih.gov/research/research-activities?related_office%5B%5D=2#research-activities-at-NCATS) to provide better care for folks in my situation would be abolished in the Project 2025 plans.  Research funding [would be gone](https://ncats.nih.gov/research/research-activities/rdcrn).  There is [the research foundation](https://www.ptenresearch.org) but their resources hardly match the US Government's.

Running would be nice but there aren't exactly many places to run to based upon where the specific patient organizations are.  There is a [UK/Ireland group](https://ptenuki.org/) as well as an [Italian group](https://www.ptenitalia.org/), [a German group](https://www.shg-cobald.de/), [a French group](https://www.syndromedecowden.com/), a [Belgian group](https://ptenbelgienederland.nl/), and a [US group](https://ptenfoundation.org/).  There is a [global support website](https://www.ptenworld.com/pten-world) but that has its limits.  When I last looked at the registry the places with the largest concentrations of known patients shown in the registry were the US, Canada, Italy, Australia, the UK, and Ireland.  The world experts are at Cleveland Clinic.

This is an overall bad scenario.  I'll have to think about it a bit.  We'll end up seeing just how numb Americans are, I think.
