Television is increasingly becoming Newton Minnow's vast wasteland.  That is to say, there's increasingly nothing on that's watchable.  Much of what's on isn't even riffable!  When I start to sound like [The Mads](https://dumb-industries.com/shows/themadsareback) or [Mike, Kevin, and Bill](https://www.rifftrax.com/about) let alone [Emily and Jonah](https://www.gizmoplex.com/) while watching regular broadcast you know something is wrong.

What's the plan as shows go on summer hiatus?  Well, we'll be watching more of [*The Mads Are Back*](https://dumb-industries.com/shows/themadsareback) at my home.  We'll probably pick up the online version of [Master Pancake Theater](https://drafthouse.com/series/master-pancake).  I'll probably visit [my local comic book store](https://robot-zero.com) more.

ABC is getting ready to launch a fall schedule made up almost entirely of "unscripted" programming.  The CW is getting set to launch a fall schedule of sports, acquired foreign programming, *All American*, and an abbreviated 13 episode season of *Walker*.  NBC cut back its schedule but is basically going to be the Dick Wolf channel.  CBS won't be changing its line-up too much but isn't totally watchable on broadcast.  PBS is great when it is of interest but there is plenty I am *not* interested in at times.

These are strange times.
