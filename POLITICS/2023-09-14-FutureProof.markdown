I'm quite possibly looking at a future that has less stable connections than we've otherwise known.  It is strongly suggested people begin to gain familiarity and proficiency in the use of [NNCP](https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/) which is a successor to [UUCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UUCP&oldid=1146511468).  Other tools may become even more useful as time goes by.  The current paradigm may not stay as stable as we would like it to be.

Future-proofing becomes needed due to connectivity failures growing in regularity.  Elon Musk randomly shutting down the entire Starlink constellation just to prevent an offensive Ukrainian operation against Russia is definitely an example of arbitrary and capricious connectivity problems we'll see increasingly in the future.  An always-online world is looking like it is disappearing slowly but surely.  It might remain in the United States *for now* but around the world we see disruptions increasing.
