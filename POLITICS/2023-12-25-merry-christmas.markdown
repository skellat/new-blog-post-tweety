Merry Christmas!

When I went to bed last night I was hoping we wouldn't end up with an incident like [what happened in Nashville in 2020](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2020_Nashville_bombing&oldid=8516117).  That's still freaky to me.  Even though it happened in Nashville it ended up causing impacts here in Ohio that day.

As far as I can tell we're having a quiet day so far.
