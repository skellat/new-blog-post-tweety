In no particular order:

* I'm stalling on writing the sermon for Sunday.  I must get that finished ASAP.
  * I need to get some UAP-related pictures.
  * I need to get some *Ancient Aliens* pictures, perhaps.
  * Yeah, the lectionary is pointing to a certain passage in 2 Peter.  This is probably going to go places.
* The feed dropped out twice during Tuesday's livestream of [*The Mads Are Back*](https://www.themadsareback.com/event/dimension-5-livestream-screening/).  I gave up the second time relative to trying to restore the feed.
* I keep fiddling with my followers list on Mastodon.
  * I download the CSV export file, edit it, and upload it back with it set to "overwrite".
  * The main changes I make beyond removing follows in bulk are to turn off "boosts" on people and to shift people to showing up in notifications.  I am my own algorithm now, it seems.
* The situation in East Palestine continues to produce horrors
  * Yes, a similar situation could happen here in Ashtabula County.
  * Governor Mike DeWine was getting uncharacteristically upset on Tuesday relative to the situation involving the train.  This is a good thing, I think.  Hopefully the feds take notice of the governor being upset.
  * The whole situation was a no-win scenario when it came to response, it seems.  There was no good solution.  Almost every solution was a *bad* solution.
* The dating game looks weird.
  * Axios Columbus mentioned on Valentine's Day that [❤️ In Ohio, love is local](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-columbus-98c5a5a0-266a-4193-a96f-10630166e816.html?chunk=1&utm_term=emshare#story1)
    * Ohio is apparently one of the states where you're most likely to marry a local
    * Michigan ranks first in terms of states where that occurs while Ohio is fifth
    * We have very few out of state transplants here in Ohio
    * In the aggregate, interstate marriages are on the rise across the country which makes Ohio an outlier
  * I'm off any dating apps at the moment.  I seemingly cannot devote the attention to correctly use such programs.
  * There are many bad prospects in my immediate area.
  * Depending upon the test results that I am waiting on from the hospital this may be mooted
* Now should be a good time in life yet isn't really
  * They're already discussing the situation in East Palestine on UCTV from University of Palestine, it seems
  * My body heat levels keep bouncing around weirdly.  Is my thyroud taking the weird approachh to functioning?
  * I'm waiting on potentially earth-shattering test results
  * Economic malaise has apparently set in
* I'll be on the hunt for commercial real estate again soon.  The weird practice locally of selling buildings at two to seven times what the county auditor values them at for taxation boggles my mind.  These aren't very attractice places to begin with...
