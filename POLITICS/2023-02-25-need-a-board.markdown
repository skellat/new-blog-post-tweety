It looks like the way forward on the streaming channel project is that I will need to recruit a board of control.  Yeah, I cannot run the thing solo.  I am no ["Benevolent Dictator For Life"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life).  Television, regardless of the transmission medium, requires the work of many to make it work.  It would be nice to offload the administrative stuff and just focus on the tech, too.

Considering the bias locally against sole proprietors I would have to do this anyhow.  There is nice guidance from [the Ohio Secretary of State](https://www.ohiosos.gov/businesses/information-on-starting-and-maintaining-a-business/starting-a-business/) as to bootstrapping a business.  There is also a guide on [how to make an LLC in this state from the Secretary of State's office](https://www.ohiosos.gov/globalassets/publications/busserv/llc.pdf).  There is a difference between impossibility and just being a pain in the butt to organize.  Hopefully I can recruit some initial board members who agree with the vision of getting this started.

Properly launching efforts by Easter would be nice.  Might it be possible?  We'll need [Nextcloud Talk](https://nextcloud.com/talk/) as well as [Nextcloud Office](https://nextcloud.com/groupware/) as well as [Collabora Online](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/) for a small/medium business back-end bit of infrastructure.  Yeah, we would need [Nextcloud Hub](https://nextcloud.com/hub/) and [Collabora Online](https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online/) as well as plenty of storage space so that we could work around the lack of an in-person workspace.  At least one perpetual license for [Corel VideoStudio Pro](https://www.videostudiopro.com/en/licensing/business/) would be beneficial as not everyone would be willing to work with [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) or [OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/).  We'd have to invest in a CDN eventually which would likely mean getting set up with [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/ott/resources/).  Various bits of gear such as [cameras](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/products/Pro-Camcorders-Cameras/ci/1881?sort=PRICE_LOW_TO_HIGH&filters=fct_a_features_2248%3Alive-streaming-capability%2Cfct_digital-interface_2247%3Ahdmi%7Cusb-c%2Cfct_mic-input-hidden_6493%3A3.5mm%2Cfct_sensor-size_7003%3A1-2.3in%7C1-2in%7C1-inch%2Cfct_system-type_2110%3Antsc), [microphones](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=camcorder%20mic&sort=PRICE_LOW_TO_HIGH&filters=fct_a_power-source_1353%3Abattery%2Cfct_category%3Ashotgun_8533%2Cfct_connector-type_4116%3A1-8in-mini%2Cfct_integrated-mount_7062%3Ayes%2Cfct_stereo-mono_1411%3Astereo), and lighting would need procuring too.  Proper "work" computers would be needed from either [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/products/Windows-Computers/ci/16360/cp/28407%2B50992%2B16360?sort=PRICE_LOW_TO_HIGH&filters=fct_a_wireless_974%3Awi-fi-6-802.11ax%2Cfct_capacity_967%3A1.5tb%7C1tb%7C2tb%2Cfct_drive-speed-type_966%3Aflash-ssd%2Cfct_external-ports_2740%3Adisplayport%7Cusb-2.0%7Cusb-3.1-gen-2-type-a%7Cusb-3.2-gen-2x2-type-c%2Cfct_operating-system_970%3Awindows-11-pro%2Cfct_processor_7612%3Aintel-core-i9-16-core-12th-gen%2Cfct_ram_965%3A32gb%7C64gb) and/or [MicroCenter](https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?N=4294967292+4294810848+4294817200+4294807310+4294811342+4294811030+4294808991+4294816371+4294808842+4294810314+4294810627+4294817474+4294809073&NTK=all&sortby=pricelow).

This could be done, I think.  We're on the way to being there, it seems.
