Now for my reaction to all this!  At present, I don't have a way to push my own transcript using [Acast](https://www.acast.com).  Presently I am listening to podcasts using [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) instead of Apple's stock podcast app.  Why use Overcast?  It is easier to keep podcast listening in sync between my tablet, phone, laptop, and smartwatch.  

Do I listen to podcasts from my smartwatch alone using a Bluetooth headset connected to the smartwatch?  Yes, I do.  Walking the chihuahua in the park is a good example of that.  Using the treadmill at home is also a good example.  The stock Apple podcast app for my watch was just too clumsy and cumbersome to use while Overwatch does what I want it to do with far less hassle.

Are they using a Whisper-like LLM to do this transcription work?  That's the big unknown to this.  Whisper is not perfect.  It also might have problems listening to [69 Admins](https://69admins.com) to be able to come up with *good* transcript results.
