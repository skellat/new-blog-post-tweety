Road trips with family can be fun.  Since I am not teaching Thursday due to the holiday I get to travel a little bit.  The teaching load that I do have kinda prevents me from traveling all that much.  

In conversation tonight it was brought up how I thought eight years ago that everything would be okay.  I foolishly thought back in 2016 that we would be able to ride out the Donald Trump presidency without too many ill effects.  Hindsight is 20/10, after all.  

That's a big part of why this time seems so different.  We know darn well what went wrong last time.  We're about to head into yet another round of things going wrong.

As of late, the crazy hat people are now floating memes online calling for televised military tribunals to judge people like Liz Cheney prior to executing them.  That's totally bizarre.  That's also not how we do things as a country.

There are many pundits putting on a brave face saying that people must fight onward.  Is it truly my fight, though?  I can't run off to fight every battle out there no matter how gallant I may seem to others.  It may come from having an undergraduate degree in history but I do want to draw lessons from Albert Einstein and Anne Frank.  If your country is starting to go down a road like the US is starting to tread then it is perhaps time to run.

The funny thing is that I had colleagues in late 2015 and late 2016 talking to me about the possibility of making a run for it then.  I thought I could hang on and things would get better.  Here we are after a plague outbreak and multiple political disasters where frankly I don't have very happy memories of the Trump administration at all.

Finding continuity of care will be tricky.  I am in a medical situation where the needed specialists are few and far flung.  Hiding out on Pitcairn Island or somewhere in Somalia might be a very bad idea for me.  I could probably make it work in eastern Australia, the Canadian province of Ontario, and in Northern Ireland or England.  Outside those areas I would wind up still having to travel to one of those areas to seek care so why have an intermediate step?  

Tomorrow is Independence Day.  For 248 years this country has been independent.  With the quintet of bombshell decisions by the United States Supreme Court (the immunity decision and the four agencies cases) it is quite fair to ask if we'll be celebrating Independence Day next year.  

On New Year's Eve 2023 I was saying "next year in Melbourne".  I was half-joking at the time.  Apparently I need to operationalize those sorts of sentiments somehow.
