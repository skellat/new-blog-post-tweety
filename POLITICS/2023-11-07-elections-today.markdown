There is a big election today here in Ohio.  Issue 1 relates to abortion rights being enshrined in the state constitution.  Yes, I voted in favor of Issue 1.  I expect passage of the issue statewide.  The big question is whether or not the issue carries passage in Ashtabula County.  If it does pass in Ashtabula County it then raises the question as to just how Republican this county really is or if the two times Trump carried the county were *anomalies* in an actually Democrat-trending county.

Results won't be known until fairly late tonight and Internet is still impaired here at home.  What could go wrong?
