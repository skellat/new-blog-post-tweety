Sometimes you end up looking at posts from the Fediverse best in blog posts.  Context really matters.  Of course, the situation we find ourselves in right now in the United States of America is a bad one.

This grossly over-simplifies and spins what is a hideously complicated situation in Texas right now.  First and foremost, you must remember that the United States of America does **not** have one single military.  Each of the fifty states has its own militia forces.  Most people think that means *solely* the dual-hatted National Guard which has both state and federal roles.  That's not entirely true as section 109 of title 32 of the United States Code [authorizes the maintenance and operation of "state defense force" formations](https://web.archive.org/web/20230519053302/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/32/109).  Not every state has chosen to operate its own state defense force but Texas has [the Texas State Guard](https://web.archive.org/web/20231107171339/https://tmd.texas.gov/state-guard).

As far as can be seen, it is the Texas State Guard that is being utilized to project the power of the state of Texas in the conflict with the federal government over the southern border.  The state government in Texas is apparently trying to ensure they don't lose control of their henchmen in the matter as using National Guard troops runs the risk of federalization under various constitutional authorities and redeployment by the Pentagon.  Clashes like this easily bring up echoes of Fort Sumter as well as the desegregation clash in 1957 in Arkansas.

What could possibly go wrong?
