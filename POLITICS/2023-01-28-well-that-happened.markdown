I don't want to say really anything about the situation in Memphis.  My local area in Ashtabula County has its own disasters in terms of crime and justice.  We have a disproportionately high number of sex crimes indictments, drug busts, and related crimes that shock the conscience. 

The way you can tell you have a crime problem is when you don't have enough judges on the county common pleas court to handle all the criminal trials that come up.  Three trial judges and one probate judge is apparently not enough for us to handle all the cases that arise.  We've had trials tossed by the county prosecutor solely on violation of constitutional speedy trial guarantee grounds too due to the backlog.

Yes, I know there is tragedy in my country.  I'm not sure I want to introduce anybody to the bad things I try to live around in my neck of the woods.  America is quite a mess at the moment.
