I will say that [NNCP](https://web.archive.org/web/20230604120450/http://www.nncpgo.org/) offers capabilities such as [bridging air gaps](https://web.archive.org/web/20230604120647/http://www.nncpgo.org/UsecaseAirgap.html).  The distributed version control system git offers [git-bundle](https://web.archive.org/web/20230604120758/https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) which could ride atop NNCP.  This presents possibilities.  If you couldn't utilize something like Gitea, GitHub, or GitLab you would still have a decent means of passing data in a non-networked fashion.

Living in a rural area with broadband that isn't 100% reliable means that considering how to work in non-connected times is definitely a need.  Infrastructure is fragile out here.  Sometimes you just end up having to change paradigms to adapt, it seems.
