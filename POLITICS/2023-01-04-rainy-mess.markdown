Well, it has been a rainy mess.  The weather is also chilling out.  We're having a roller coaster winter in terms of conditions.

It is a rainy, flood mess with plenty of fog out there.  There's not really anywhere enclosed that I want to go.  The outdoors places that I would normally visit are presently flooding.

My print copy of the final report of the Select Committee to Investigat the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol arrived today from the Government Printing Office.  Yeah, it is heavy.  I don't have to worry about it being memory-holed by the MAGA crazies, though.
