Well, Friday was certainly interesting.  My day started with a telcon as well as a visit to a local medical facility for an outpatient diagnostic procedure.  I am still waiting for the results of the diagnostic procedure and may not hear back until Tuesday perhaps.  

Later in the day we heard of a young man self-immolating outside a courthouse in Manhattan.  It appears that the young man, apparently a conspiracy theorist with a Substack account, set himself on fire in a park opposite the courthouse where Donald Trump is standing trial.  Before ignition the person had posted a nearly three thousand word long screed to Sbstack explaining his views and why he set himself ablaze.  While the screed is most aligned with far-right views it still takes positions that are most charitably regarded as being paranoid and delusional.  

Why does that incident in a park in Manhattan even matter?  Now that a jury is seated for this trial of Donal Trump we'll see proceedings begin on Monday.  We can easily see more people attempt to engage in a variety of disruptive acts.  It also isn't that far to go for far right people to go from self-immolation to engage in outwardly aggressive acts.  

As we begin to head into the general election season I frankly have a bad feeling.  Are we likely to see outbreaks of violence in weird places?  It seems like the answer is yes.  I just don't know what the next step is after self-immolation in terms of the continuum of violence with what constitutes today's "right wing".

Eventually I must return to working on the bolthole project...
