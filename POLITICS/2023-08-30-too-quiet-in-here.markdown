It is getting too quiet in here.  I suppose that means it is time for another blog post.

Well, Florida is going to be a mess soon.  The VoIP Hurricane Net is [activating Wednesday](https://web.archive.org/web/20230830040706/https://voipwx.net/2023/08/29/voip-hurricane-net-will-activate-wednesday-morning-8-30-23-6-am-edt-through-11-pm-edt-for-hurricane-idalia/) to respond with this situation.  I'll likely be listening in since I am nowhere near the targeted area and won't directly connect to the EchoLink node(s).

From there we shift to the problem of decay at Google.  Quoting @billbennett@mastodon.nz: <https://mastodon.nz/@billbennett/110976040958094828> #retoot

I'm not sure how much more I can say to that.  My preferred search engine lately is either DuckDuckGo or Bing.  I don't really get decent results from Google either lately.

There's not really a good let alone innocent explanation for that.

I wish I could say there are simpler times ahead.  I'm not supposed to lie.
