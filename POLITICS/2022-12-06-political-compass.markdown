Well, sometimes online tests give strange results.  Consider this chart:

![Output from the "political compass" site showing a result for me of left-libertarian.  In our shifting times what do left and right even more?]({{site.url}}/img/politicalcompass.png)

I ended up taking the "political compass" test available at [politicalcompass.org](https://www.politicalcompass.org/).  I was surprised at the output.  Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised based upon the shifts in the right lately.

I encourage people to try the test themselves.
