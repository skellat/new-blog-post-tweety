This was seen on the [data dashboard](https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/view/covid-19-reporting):

![Dashboard screenshot showing only 8,635 residents of Ashtabula County have received the updated COVID-19 vaccine.  That is only 8.88% of the local population!  This is not good.]({{site.url}}/img/vaxing-end-of-2023.jpg)

I am just at a loss.  This is just another facet of our [poor health outcomes locally](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/ohio/ashtabula?year=2023).  It isn't like [PLACES](https://www.cdc.gov/places/index.html) shows Ashtabula County in all that great of a shape.

I have to assess options.
