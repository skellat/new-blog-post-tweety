I will dig this small item out of the quarantine grave:

>*Imagine: [putting on weight while having very low end blood sugar and it isn't necessarily insulin resistance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22970944/).*

Yeah, being in that cohort is not fun.  I've heard about "keto diet" being one of the somewhat viable ways to manage the matter.  The problem with that is that there are countervailing factors that *may* prevent adopting such a thing.

Sometimes the complexity in life can be rather odd, I suppose.
