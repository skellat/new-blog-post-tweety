Well, that was certainly an election night!  Voters in 25 of Ohio's 88 counties were numerous enough to be *more than one half of the overall voters voting on the question* and caused Issue 1 to be passed.  The "three C's" (Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati) plus Toledo and Dayton as well as Painesville/Mentor, Chardon, Ashtabula, Athens, Bowling Green, Youngstown, Cortland, and Put in Bay were all part of the areas of the state that voted to pass this.  Issue 1 will enshrine abortion rights in the Ohio state constitution in roughly 30 days.

It is a pity that this probably didn't settle anything at all.  Julie Carr Smyth had an interesting report run by the Associated Press linked [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108033900/https://apnews.com/article/ohio-abortion-amendment-election-2023-fe3e06747b616507d8ca21ea26485270).  Here's the part that bothers me:

>*Republicans remained defiant in the wake of Tuesday’s vote. Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens said Issue 1’s approval “is not the end of the conversation.”*

>*“As a 100% pro-life conservative, I remain steadfastly committed to protecting life, and that commitment is unwavering,” Stephens said. “The Legislature has multiple paths that we will explore to continue to protect innocent life.”*

>*Previously, state Senate President Matt Huffman, a Republican, has suggested that lawmakers could come back with another proposed amendment next year that would undo Issue 1, although they would have only a six-week window after Election Day to get it on the 2024 primary ballot.*

We are a "Super Tuesday" state so this very well could come back to haunt us in March during the presidential primary.  If it does there might well be some havoc.  After almost a full year being overwhelmed with this issue and facing the special election in August that tried to derail this effort I think voters would move hard to punish legislators if they pushed an immediate repeal attempt.

There are some weird costs to living in this state...
