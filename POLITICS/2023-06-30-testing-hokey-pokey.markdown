Friday saw me visiting University Hospitals Geauga Medical Center for a visit to their radiology department.  I had to have a procedure done there that the facilities in Geneva, Ashtabula, and Conneaut were not equipped to handle.  That resulted in my being in Chardon from noon to about 3:30 PM local time.  

What was the procedure?  Well, it was nuclear stress test imaging.  We were adenoma hunting.  An ultrasound was not conclusive so we needed to find whether it was there or not.  The confusing result from the imaging Friday was that it was *not* found.  

I look forward to hearing from the ordering physician what they think is going on in this case.  We're in uncharted territory with quite a bit of this already.  The conundrums we face in this care odyssey is fodder for journal articles.
