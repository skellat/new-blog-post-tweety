Well, the colloquy in the Senate [was less clear than mud](https://archive.org/details/BLOOMBERG_20230307_150000_Bloomberg_Markets_Americas/start/2652.3/end/2780.2) as to the possibility of a debt default.  We're still having problems [agreeing on what collective memory of major events should be](https://archive.org/details/CNNW_20230308_180000_CNN_Newsroom/start/2888.6/end/2958.6).  Fox News is completing its transformation into a [warped version of RT/Russia Today](https://archive.org/details/FOXNEWSW_20230310_010000_Tucker_Carlson_Tonight/start/1499.6/end/1762.2) and is incredibly pro-Putin now.  

There is not as much certainty in life right as I would like.  I did get *some* small degree of certainty on Thursday morning when some folks at University Hospitals of Cleveland conveyed to me test results as well as a diagnosis.  Yes, I now have two diagnoses on my chart that fall under the definition of "rare diseases".  The good news is that they better explain some of the baffling conditions that have stumped my doctors.  The problem is that they're not exactly minor or benign issues.  Life will be going in some new directions now, I suppose.

If the news is any indication I may not be the only one seeing new directions ahead, I guess...
