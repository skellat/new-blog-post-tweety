Incomplete and scattered reports indicate that the Wagner Group and its commander have abandoned the front in Ukraine either in whole or in part and have marched back into Russia.  They're apparently *not* doing so peacefully.  Things are developing as time goes by.

Of course, there are some folks out in the fediverse that are okay with this situation.  Quoting @lauren@mastodon.laurenweinstein.org: <https://mastodon.laurenweinstein.org/@lauren/110597212085272373> #retoot

It appears that [even NBC News has started to notice the situation](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/what-is-the-wagner-group-rcna90932).

At the very least we have **not** seen reports of Swan Lake playing on a loop in broadcast outlets in the Russian Federation.  That would be the big hint that a coup is rather further along than we would like to see.  This weekend is likely to get pretty exciting.

For some reason I'm having oddball thoughts about archiving data using [Kansas City Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kansas_City_standard&oldid=1140604070), [cylinder phonographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phonograph_cylinder&oldid=1151598142) such as seen [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20210918113114/https://twitter.com/BL_DramaSound/status/867737576056258561) and [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20230322183530/http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/2019/4/24/hi-122-wax-cylinders), and [lots of error correction coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Error_correction_code&oldid=1158413565).  That's just silliness, I suppose.  These are strange times that we live in...
