Well, we have a presidential candidate promising and doing many things.  So far we have:

+ A pogrom launched by that man in southern Ohio
+ Mentions by him of carrying out ethnic cleansing if elected
+ Preemptive blaming of Jewish people if he loses the election
+ Many fascism-inspired proposals

On Sunday I actually sent the first seeking-refuge inquiry out.  I finally crossed that line.  I'm not expecting a positive response whatsoever.

This is not a good place for this country to be.  I don't really have a way to bunker down.  If I could buy 50-100 acres of land then bunkering would be far easier than my little tenth of an acre city plot.  Of course, if I could manage to nab a contiguous 4,480 acres here in Ohio I would control an area equal in size to a civil township...  

Sleep might help, I suppose.
