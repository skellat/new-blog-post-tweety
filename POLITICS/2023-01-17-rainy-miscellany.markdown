As to the M2 chip item, reports this morning came out that told us that we would be seeing new fourteen and sixteen inch MacBook Pro laptops hitting the market with such chips as well as Mac Mini units with M2 chips.  The Intel and M1 Mac Mini units are off the deck now as to sales.  Since we lack capital to make purchases at the moment there won't be any great rush to go out and get anything.
