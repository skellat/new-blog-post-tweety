Apparently I *may* have thyroid problems.

The unexplained weight gain on the order of 40 pounds was probably a good clue that something was wrong.  After a couple ultrasounds and a nuclear stress test it appears that there is what is being called a "mild thyroid goiter".  Due to the omnipresent *big, bad rare disease* my potential for thyroid cancer is around thirty times that of the average person.

I'll be waiting for a call from the endocrinologist in the week ahead.  She may want me back in Cleveland for yet more tests.  She may want to handle coordination of care which means visiting additional offices potentially.

Dealing with all this can be a bit of a drag.  I do feel like a lab rat some days.  There is hope, though.
