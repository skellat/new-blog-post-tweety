In no particular order:

+ Phone troubles might be resolved
  + The old iPhone started having speech dispatcher problems and other data integrity issues
  + I bought an unlocked iPhone of a somewhat recent vintage to replace the dying device
  + I'm holding on to the dying device to use as a trade-in assist if new iPads are ever announced
  + The current iPad would pass down to a family member if I managed to get a replacement/upgrade unit this year
+ The Charlotte Shooting
  + Yep, this was a sovcit situation
  + These folks are coming out of the woodwork
  + By the time we hit Election Day we will have major problems
+ Teaching
  + Teaching the online section is kicking my butt
  + Teaching face to face is much, much easier
  + I may get my summer off if we don't get sufficient enrollment in either of my two sections
    + There are minimum enrollment thresholds to hit
    + It is still early days in terms of enrolling for the summer term
  + I made a stupid mistake in the way I set up this week's discussion in the online section and I'll be regretting it
+ The Political Situation
  + Trump is getting scarier
  + Project 2025 is a blueprint for destruction
  + I'm not running against anybody this year
  + The protests across the country are raising people's anxiety levels
+ Podcast Listening
  + I'm enjoying *Dragon Friends* lately
  + Yes, I'm looking for the escapism
  + I've been listening to *Role To Cast* while commuting round-trip relative to the college
  + I do still listen to *Late Night Linux* family shows
    + I don't listen to all of them, though
    + I skip some of them in my feed
    + I make time for *Linux Matters* and *Late Night Linux*
  + Production of *69 Admins* continues as it follows the twists and turns of trying to watch streaming television in rural America
+ Feelings
  + Anxiety has been bouncing around a bit
  + Stress has been bouncing around a bit
  + There's been some situations I haven't exactly had the most control over that have caused both to get a little bonkers
+ Things I Want To Do
  + Get back to writing for pleasure
  + Increase the amount of distance covered in "hiking"
  + Get my weight back under better control
  + Publish something on either Smashwords or DriveThruRPG
  + Move onward to somewhere that is more stable socioeconomically than Ashtabula happens to be lately
