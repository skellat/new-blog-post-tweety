## The Site That Is

### An Explanation

Due to the [challenged operational environment currently in existence](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump), some action is in play.  A tiny crowdfunder is in play at <https://gofund.me/b93d1f25> to raise money for research into possible supporting material for a citizenship by descent application.  If successful this would allow me to possibly secure citizenship in an EU member state that is part of the Schengen area.

I can't say for certain that I know what is coming.  The outlook is pretty bad.  We voted in crazy authoritarians here and now we're going to get what we wished for good and hard.  I didn't vote for this but I will have to endure it.

It is time for an escape route.  Family thought I was being overblown.  They're seeing now that the concern is justified.
