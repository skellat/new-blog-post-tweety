# The "Blog" Post-Tweety

There used to be a blog here.  For now this is being presented as a day book using [LaTeXML](https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML).  Yes, I am keeping this using LaTeX.  I *suppose* I could have used [lwarp](https://ctan.org/pkg/lwarp) if I wanted to make an EPUB version available but that's something for another day.

This is generally edited using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via [GitHub Pages](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&oldid=8334105#GitHub_Pages).  

Reader discretion is advised as this can go interesting places.
