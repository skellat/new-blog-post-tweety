# The Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding and its content.  I have [a user account on a Mastodon instance](https://ubuntu.social/@alpacaherder) and new posts from this blog are auto-posted to it using automation on a free tier ARM instance on Oracle Cloud as well as feed2toot.  RSS is available on this blog and the use of RSS is rather encouraged.  

This is mainly edited using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via [GitHub Pages](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&oldid=8334105#GitHub_Pages).  Transitions can happen in the future to alternate forms of hosting such as to infrastructure I personally own but for now this stays structured just as it is.  

Reader discretion is cheerfully encouraged.
