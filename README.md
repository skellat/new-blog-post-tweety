# New Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding and its content.  I have [a user account on a Mastodon instance](https://mas.to/@smkellat) and new posts from this blog are auto-posted to it using automation on a free tier ARM instance on Oracle Cloud.  RSS is available and its use is encouraged.  The Twitter account was deactivated on January 24th and is **not** returning.  Twitter has become a bad neighborhood these days.

This is edited primarily using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via [Netlify](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Netlify&oldid=1137585522).  Transitions can happen in the future to alternate forms of hosting but for now this stays structured as it is.

Reader discretion is cheerfully encouraged.
