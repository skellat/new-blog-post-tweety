# New Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding and its content.  I have [a user account on a Mastodon instance](https://ubuntu.social/@alpacaherder) and new posts from this blog are auto-posted to it using automation on a free tier ARM instance on Oracle Cloud.  RSS is available and its use is encouraged.  The Twitter account was deactivated on January 24th and is **not** returning.  Twitter has become a bad neighborhood these days.  Facebook is not much better and the final deletion process was initiated on March 11th after leaving the account laying fallow for nearly two years.

This is edited primarily using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via [Netlify](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Netlify&oldid=1137585522).  Transitions can happen in the future to alternate forms of hosting but for now this stays structured as it is.

Reader discretion is cheerfully encouraged.
