# The Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding and its content.  I have [a user account on a Mastodon instance](https://ubuntu.social/@alpacaherder) and new posts from this blog are auto-posted to it using automation on a free tier ARM instance on Oracle Cloud.  RSS is available and its use is encouraged.  

The old Twitter account was terminated on January 24th.  Twitter has become a very bad neighborhood these days.  I have no plans to return to using Twitter unless required to do so by any future employment.

This is edited primarily using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via [Netlify](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Netlify&oldid=1137585522).  Transitions can happen in the future to alternate forms of hosting but for now this stays structured just as it is.  This blog may enter "expeditionary operations mode" depending upon the outcome of certain external events which means that it is strongly suggested people begin to gain familiarity and proficiency in the use of [NNCP](https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/) which is a successor to [UUCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UUCP&oldid=1146511468).

Reader discretion is cheerfully encouraged.
