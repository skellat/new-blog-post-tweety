# New Blog Post-Tweety

This is the scaffolding behind the new blog that will supplanting my tweeting.  With Mr. Musk making the place a dumpster fire it is time to be making moves.  I am tired of the craziness.  My Twitter account was left fallow as of the night of November 6th, 2022.  I won't delete as I do not want to lose the user name to a squatter.  Somehow there is [an incipient user account on a Mastodon instance](https://mas.to/@smkellat) but that is a situation that is in-flux.

This is edited primarily using Visual Studio Code.  Hosting is handled via Netlify.  Transitions can happen in the future but it has to start somewhere, eh?
