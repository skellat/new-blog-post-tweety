# The Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding and its content.  The use of the blog's RSS feed is **highly** encouraged.  I may end up being nomadic in the Fediverse but this blog is pretty much staying put.

This is generally edited using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via [GitHub Pages](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&oldid=8334105#GitHub_Pages).  [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) is in use as of April 2024 to track any image files in the repository so that storage is easier.  You **must** have Git LFS installed to be able to clone the entire repository cleanly.

Reader discretion is advised.
