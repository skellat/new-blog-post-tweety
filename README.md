# The Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding and its content.  I have [a user account on a Mastodon instance](https://ubuntu.social/@alpacaherder) and new posts from this blog are auto-posted to it using automation on a free tier ARM instance on Oracle Cloud (provided the instance doesn't get reclaimed too aggressively).  RSS is available and its use is encouraged.  

This is edited primarily using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via [Netlify](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Netlify&oldid=1137585522).  Transitions can happen in the future to alternate forms of hosting but for now this stays structured just as it is.  

This blog may eventually enter "expeditionary operations mode" depending upon the outcome of certain external events which means that it is strongly suggested people begin to gain familiarity and proficiency in the use of [NNCP](https://nncp.mirrors.quux.org/) which is a successor to [UUCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UUCP&oldid=1146511468).  What is "expeditionary operations mode"?  It is a paradigm shift to older operating tactics.

Reader discretion is cheerfully encouraged.
