# New Blog Post-Tweety

This is the scaffolding behind the new blog that will supplanting my tweeting.  With Mr. Musk making the place a dumpster fire it is time to be making moves.  I am tired of the craziness.  My Twitter account was left fallow as of the night of November 6th, 2022.  I won't delete as I do not want to lose the user name to a squatter.  There is [a user account on a Mastodon instance](https://mas.to/@smkellat) and new posts from this blog are auto-posted to it.

Writing can be a form of therapy.  This is helpful to me.  Whether or not these posts are helpful to others is up for debate.

This is edited primarily using Visual Studio Code.  Hosting is handled via Netlify.  Transitions can happen in the future but it has to start somewhere, eh?
