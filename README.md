# New Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding and content.  I have [a user account on a Mastodon instance](https://mas.to/@smkellat) and new posts from this blog are auto-posted to it.  RSS is available and its use is encouraged.  You won't see posts from this blog showing up on Twitter due to action by me since IFTTT is apparently *being blocked* by Twitter as of January 14th.

Writing is a form of therapy.  This is helpful to me.  Whether or not these posts are helpful to others is up for debate.

This is edited primarily using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via Netlify.  Transitions can happen in the future to alternate forms of hosting but for now this stays put here.

Reader discretion is cheerfully encouraged.
