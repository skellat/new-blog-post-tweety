# The Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding and its content.  I have [a user account on a wonderful Mastodon instance](https://ubuntu.social/@alpacaherder) and new posts from this blog are auto-posted to it using automation on a free tier ARM instance on Oracle Cloud as well as feed2toot.  The use of the blog's RSS feed is highly encouraged.  

This is generally edited using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via [GitHub Pages](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&oldid=8334105#GitHub_Pages).  Hosting infrastructures may occur but the planning for such a thing has yet to occur.  

A very weird 2024 awaits as January has already started off strangely.  With that in mind, I must investigate distributing this as git bundles over non-Internet routes.  The use of [NNCP](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602114413/http://www.nncpgo.org/Git.html) is quite possible.  Erecting a [cgit instance](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/) on a [pagekite](https://pagekite.net)-based server may also be appropriate.

Reader discretion is advised.
