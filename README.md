# The Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding and its content.  The use of the blog's RSS feed is **highly** encouraged.  As my position in the Fediverse is in question as of late February 2024 it does seem that links will cease to be auto-posted by March perhaps.

This is generally edited using [Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Visual_Studio_Code&oldid=1128781165).  Hosting is handled via [GitHub Pages](https://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GitHub&oldid=8334105#GitHub_Pages).  Hosting infrastructures may occur but the planning for such a thing has yet to occur.  

A very weird 2024 is in progress.  With that in mind, I must investigate distributing this as git bundles over non-Internet routes.  The use of [NNCP](https://web.archive.org/web/20220602114413/http://www.nncpgo.org/Git.html) is quite possible.  Erecting a [cgit instance](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/) on a [pagekite](https://pagekite.net)-based server may also be appropriate.

Reader discretion is advised.
