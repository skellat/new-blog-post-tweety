# New Blog Post-Tweety

This is the scaffolding behind the new blog that will supplanting my tweeting.  Why do this at all?  Elon Musk taking over Twitter is already in the process of crashing the place.

This is edited primarily using Visual Studio Code.  Hosting is handled via Netlify.  Transitions can happen in the future but it has to start somewhere, eh?
