# New Blog Post-Tweety

This is my blog's scaffolding.  I have [a user account on a Mastodon instance](https://mas.to/@smkellat) and new posts from this blog are auto-posted to it.  RSS is available, of course.

Writing can be a form of therapy.  This is helpful to me.  Whether or not these posts are helpful to others is up for debate.

This is edited primarily using Visual Studio Code.  Hosting is handled via Netlify.  Transitions can happen in the future but it has to start somewhere, eh?

Reader discretion is cheerfully encouraged.
