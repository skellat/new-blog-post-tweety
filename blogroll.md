In bizarre times like these it is necessary to share good blogs and podcasts.  Search engines increasingly return garbage results and have reduced usefulness.  We may perhaps need to return to the ways of old.

A totally random non-comprehensive judgmental sampling of blogs and podcasts from both my [feed reader tracking](https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/FeedReadingFeeds) and my podcast [tracking monitor](https://code.launchpad.net/~skellat/+git/Podcasting) includes:
