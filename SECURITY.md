# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

There is no deployable software as this is a static site.  There are therefore no supported versions as there are no releases of software.  In theory there may be an interception problem if there is a man-in-the-middle attack upon Netlify.  There can also be a problem if GitHub is attacked as we may not be fully aware of problems on their end.
