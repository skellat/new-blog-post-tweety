I have a silly view of the VP pick. Who do I think \emph{should} be
picked? The best bet is Josh Shapiro, the Governor of Pennsylvania. Who
do I think \emph{will} be picked? More than likely it will be Tim Walz,
the Governor of Minnesota.

This being the world turned upside down this campaign season frankly
anything can happen. We'll find out Tuesday, I suppose.
