\textbf{Evening}

No, I haven't been taking well the news of Donald Trump apparently
winning the presidency. This is likely to lead to many, many problems.
Contingency plans are now happening.

\textbf{Overnight}

Let's talk about the cyberpunk-style things I'm going to have to be
doing now. There's so much work to be done to get ready. After all,
there's risk that we're going to see Trump invoking 47 USC 706 to start
shutting down communications. That statute can only be invoked during a
state of war. Technically the country has been at war for 70 years as
the Korean conflict has never ended. He has means of invoking that
provision legitimately.

Things to consider as options in light of all the craziness potentially
looming include but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Get a FreedomBox set up
\item
  Rig up something akin to a PirateBox in a strategic location
\item
  Set up a ``captive portal'' wireless access point
\item
  Start building scripting around NNCP
\end{itemize}

That's a limited initial list. There's likely plenty more to be done
yet.
