\emph{Early Evening}

Here we go again. Thanks to the blog having to be taken offline during
the quiet period of the political season I am shifting to this. It isn't
good to keep everything in my head. I have to write at least \emph{some}
of this down somewhere.

Yes, I am afraid of a Trump victory. The dude is following the Nazi
playbook. I am frankly amazed that we may well see a killer like RFK
Jr.~be put into a role over health policy. Sweeping under the rug the
amount of deaths he caused in Samoa during the measles crisis in 2019
does not make it okay to put him in charge of health policy in the
United States of America now. For someone with a rare disease like PTEN
Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome that could be quite complicating if that mean
is put in charge of policy.

The passport renewal is in play. All I can do right now is wait. Once
that is back I can look at bugging out. There does seem to be nowhere to
realistically go, though.

Efforts are under way to build media acquisition channels in the event
of him winning. The light of freedom has to stay on somehow. If I have
to hide a satellite receiver somewhere to pick up Deutsche Welle and/or
France 24 then that is what may well come.

I didn't want the crazy to come back yet here we are. People actually
want this. Are these truly \emph{my} people?
