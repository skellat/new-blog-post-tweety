It is now Christmas Eve.  The maelstrom is increasing as the craziness from the president-elect is just picking up in intensity.  I don't see how we will be sticking around by the end of 2025.  The likelihood of needing to make a run for it is increasing.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \href{https://www.hauppauge.com/pages/webstore2/webstore_pctv461e.html}{satellite tuner USB dongle} arrived from Hauppauge.  Now we need to figure out building the machine to \href{https://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Pinnacle_PCTV_DVB-S2_Stick_(461e)}{utilize it} with \href{https://tvheadend.org/p/downloads}{Tvheadend}.  
    \item I still have presents to wrap.
    \item I need to work on contingency plans if things go haywire in the coming days in terms of being a teacher.
    \item I am horrified that Donald Trump is out to do bad things to the nice people in Canada, Panama, and Greenland.
    \item Updating this more often should be a goal but frankly I am just emotionally exhausted by the maelstrom lately.
