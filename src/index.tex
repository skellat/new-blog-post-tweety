\section{Introduction}
This is a reformatting of my prior blog to be made available using LaTeXML.  This is an experiment.  It \emph{may} work.  

Yes, I'm working in \LaTeX.  What about it?  Bear in mind that this is very incomplete as posts are ported over manually.
\section{Following Updates}
Since this is not properly a blog there is no RSS feed.  You \emph{can} follow the Atom feed for its GitHub repository using \url{https://github.com/skellat/new-blog-post-tweety/commits/master.atom} to track commits to see when new updates are made.  It is not likely that an RSS feed will be added prior to the close of 2025, if ever.  That would require some hefty revision to the base \LaTeX code.

For posting to the web there is a bespoke GitHub Action utilized.  It presently looks like this:

\lstinputlisting{static-latexml.yml}

It probably needs editing.
