Communications over the Windstream fiber connection are not functioning
properly. I don't think both GitHub and DriveThruRPG are down at the
same time. Unless there's been a nuclear attack on the West Coast that
nobody noticed, this is a transport failure.

It makes it worse that it is an \emph{intermittent} failure too!
