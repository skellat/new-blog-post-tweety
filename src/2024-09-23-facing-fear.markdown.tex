Well, we have a presidential candidate promising and doing many things.
So far we have:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A pogrom launched by that man in southern Ohio
\item
  Mentions by him of carrying out ethnic cleansing if elected
\item
  Preemptive blaming of Jewish people if he loses the election
\item
  Many fascism-inspired proposals
\end{itemize}

On Sunday I actually sent the first seeking-refuge inquiry out. I
finally crossed that line. I'm not expecting a positive response
whatsoever.

This is not a good place for this country to be. I don't really have a
way to bunker down. If I could buy 50-100 acres of land then bunkering
would be far easier than my little tenth of an acre city plot. Of
course, if I could manage to nab a contiguous 4,480 acres here in Ohio I
would control an area equal in size to a civil township\ldots{}

Sleep might help, I suppose.
