Well, Tim Walz was apparently picked as the running mate for Kamala
Harris. I apparently called it yesterday. It wasn't exactly a
\emph{hard} call. There was way, way too much of a full court press
against Josh Shapiro. The incendiary issue of Israel would've been
inserted into the campaign if Governor Shapiro was selected too. With
protestors about Palestine already set to protest the Democratic
National Convention a pick of Josh Shapiro would made too many waves in
an environment that requires perfect pinpoint execution with almost no
margin of error.

I'm still going to vote for the firm of Harris-Walz over Trump-Vance on
November 5th. We \textbf{CANNOT} go back to the madness of the Trump
years. The cost of doing so would simply be too high.
