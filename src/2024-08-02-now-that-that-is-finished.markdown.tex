In no particular order:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Another term at \{redacted\} is done.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    I now have 11 offerings of the same class completed
  \item
    I think I may now know what I'm doing with this by now
  \end{itemize}
\item
  I end up missing the big visit by \{redacted\} at \{redacted\} next
  week
\item
  The visit to the specialist doctor on Wednesday was a bit confusing
\item
  I want to get some repairs done around the house
\item
  I have to figure out what I am swapping in for the previous VPS I was
  using on Oracle Cloud that I lost the ability to manage via the
  management console due to losing 2FA override codes
\item
  At certain points I am seeing people during the current Olympic games
  talking about health-related issues on Mastodon and left wondering. I
  understand the concern about people feeling they fall outside the
  norms. For those questioning things about health status just go get
  one of the consumer grade genetics tests to start. I know 23andMe
  tests for things like Cowden Syndrome among other interesting things.
  If you get a hit on it they tell you to see a doctor to properly
  confirm. If you think you might be a wee bit abnormal health-wise
  perhaps you might start there?
\item
  The big MRI of \{redacted\} in seven days is going to be needlessly
  exciting as we'll be determining if something is steady state or if it
  has grown. Hopefully it has not grown.
\end{itemize}
