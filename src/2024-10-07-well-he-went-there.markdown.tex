Headline from POLITICO:
``\href{https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/07/trump-immigrants-crime-00182702}{Trump
on immigrants: `We got a lot of bad genes in our country right now'}''

Even for non-immigrants in the United States

with all sorts of genetic disorders}, this is downright terrifying that
he's talking like this. We saw the pogrom here in Ohio against Haitian
immigrants down in Springfield. If that monster starts a pogrom against
people with genetic disorders thanks to his foolish remarks about ``bad
genes'' then quite a cross-section of America would be in danger.

HOW MUCH MORE ARYAN DOES THIS ORANGE MONSTER NEED TO GET BEFORE PEOPLE
TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY?

It isn't like people with rare genetic disorders

the easiest of times managing things} as it is.

The big fear is that he gets elected because my fellow countrymen
basically went insane. If that happens frankly my position becomes quite
unsafe. I'm going to have to look harder at boltholes, I think.
