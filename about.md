This blog's maintainer is Stephen Michael Kellat.  

Stephen's non-academic endeavors can be supported financially via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/smkellat) and [Patreon](https://patreon.com/erielookingproductions).  Support is encouraged to allow him to be able to work on creative endeavors without the uncertainties of "contingent academic labor".  Our economy is *extremely* weird right now.  What might these non-academic endeavors entail?  Typically they involve literary and artistic creation.
