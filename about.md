In 2022 late on October 27th the social media site Twitter was taken over by the aerospace oligarch Elon Musk.  The site began to deteriorate in quality almost immediately after his corporate takeover.  Changes [are being phased in as to content moderation](http://web.archive.org/web/20221028230533/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63428848) though those changes are not expected to be beneficial to the masses.  

This blog was erected to provide an outpost and refuge away from the stormy seas brewing on Twitter.  It is uncertain how long many people can hold on at Twitter.  Time changes many things.

The author of this blog, Stephen Michael Kellat, is described in his Twitter bio with: "Geriatric Millennial/Fiction Author/Computer & Information Systems Teacher/TeX User Group Member/Amateur Radio Operator/Lapsed Librarian"
