The maintainer of this blog is Stephen Michael Kellat.  

Stephen's creative endeavors can be supported financially via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/smkellat).  Support is encouraged to allow him to be able to work on creative endeavors such as writing fiction, creating things using LaTeX, and returning more to podcasting.  Podcasting as just a side hustle is rough.
